		<h2>What is a Provider?</h2>
		<p>
			A provider is an entity that helps facilitate the exchange of currencies. If you have 100 USDT
			and want to exchange it for naira, you will need an exchange provider to convert your USDT to
			naira. A provider can be an individual or entity. On Monierate, we only list trusted entities
			for you to choose from, not individual traders.
		</p>
	</span>
	<span class="block mb-4">
		<h3>What is Buy Price?</h3>
		<p>
			The buy price is the rate at which you pay to convert naira to dollars. It represents how much
			naira you're paying for every dollar obtained. For instance, if you have naira but need USDT
			to pay a bill, you exchange your naira for USDT, and the provider credits USDT to you at the
			buy price.
		</p>
	</span>
	<span class="block mb-4">
		<h3>What is Sell Price?</h3>
		<p>
			The sell price is the rate at which you pay to convert dollars to naira. It represents how
			much naira you're getting for every dollar exchanged. For instance, if you have USDT but need
			naira to pay a bill, you exchange your USDT for naira, and the provider credits naira to you
			at the sell price.
		</p>
	</span>
	<span class="block mb-4">
		<h3>Why is the buy price usually higher than the sell price?</h3>
		<p>
			Exchange providers make money from the difference between the buying and selling prices of the
			dollar. This is commonly known as arbitrage or trading profitâ€”buying low and selling high. If
			you have USDT but need naira, they buy the USDT from you at a lower naira price and sell it at
			a higher naira price to someone else who needs USDT.
