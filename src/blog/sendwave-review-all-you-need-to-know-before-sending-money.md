 Now, let’s explore the countries Sendwave operates in.


#### Eligible Countries and Currencies

At this time, [Sendwave](https://www.sendwave.com/en) enables international remittances from regions like the United States, Canada, the UK, and several European countries, supporting transactions in British Pounds (GBP), Canadian Dollars (CAD), Euros (EUR), and US Dollars (USD).

Recipients can receive funds in destinations across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, including Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Peru. With over 250 sending and receiving combinations and 88 currency pairings, Sendwave offers extensive coverage for global money transfers. 


#### Getting started on Sendwave

Before you begin, ensure you have a registered Sendwave account. Registration is quick and easy: you need to be at least 18 years old, reside in one of Sendwave's supported countries, and own a valid debit card. Once set up, you're ready to make your first transfer.

Sending money on the platform requires minimal steps. All you need is your recipient’s details, the amount to send, and your debit card details to fund the transfer. 

If you haven’t signed up yet, here’s a simple step-by-step guide to follow:

**Step 1:** Download the Sendwave app from Google Play or the Apple Store, depending on your device.

**Step 2:** Enter your name, email address, and phone number to sign up.

**Step 3:** Link your debit card by providing the card details.

**Step 4:** Enter the recipient’s required details.

**Step 5:** Choose the amount to send.

**Step 6:** Review the transaction details, confirm the transfer, and let Sendwave handle the rest.

Whether you’re sending money to loved ones or funding your own account for travel, the app ensures a smooth and efficient process.

**Receiving money**

This varies based on the delivery method available in the recipient's country. Here’s how it works:

- **Cash Pickup:** The sender provides a unique voucher code and one-time password via SMS. Take these along with a valid ID to a designated cash pickup location, such as a partner bank or agent, to collect your funds. Currently, this service is available in Senegal.

- **Mobile Money:** Transfers are sent directly to mobile wallets like M-Pesa, MTN, or Airtel, with an SMS notification confirming the deposit. This method is supported in countries such as Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ghana, Senegal, and Liberia, offering instant access to funds.

- **Bank Deposits:** Funds are transferred directly into a bank account, usually within 1-3 business days. This option is available for recipients in Kenya, Uganda, and Nigeria, with banks notifying customers once the money arrives.

Delivery methods depend on the recipient’s location. Be sure to check which options are available in your country before initiating a transfer.


## Using Sendwave: Payment methods and Transfer speeds

To send money with Sendwave, you’ll need to link your bank account through Trustly and confirm your ID with basic details like your name and address. Once that’s done, you’re good to go with these payment options:

- **Bank Account**: Link your current account directly for transfers.

- **Debit Card**: Use your Visa or Mastercard debit card.

As for how fast your money gets there, it really depends on how you’re sending it:

Using mobile wallets usually takes just a few seconds, and the recipient gets an SMS as soon as it’s done. For bank deposits, it takes a little longer, around 1-3 business days, depending on the recipient’s bank. And, using the cash pickup option, as soon as the recipient has the voucher code and password, they can grab the cash in minutes at a designated agent location.

It’s always a good idea to double-check the delivery times before sending, especially if you’re on a tight schedule.

## Fees

Sendwave keeps fees simple and transparent. In most markets, there are no fees—your recipient gets the full amount, with Sendwave earning a small margin from the exchange rate. 

For example, sending $1,000 from the U.S. to Ghana may result in a rate around 14.77 GHS per USD, with no additional fees. Where fees are charged, like in Liberia, they’re kept low to ensure affordability.

Sendwave also applies a small spread on the mid-market exchange rate, which varies depending on your recipient’s currency. 


#### Payment Limits

When you start using Sendwave, you’ll encounter sending limits like:

- A daily limit starting at $999 and a monthly cap of $2,999 for new users.

- With ID verification, limits increase to $2,999 per day and $12,000 per month.

For higher limits, users in the U.S., UK, or EU will have their limits automatically adjusted over time based on eligibility. Canadian users can even request an increase directly through the app, with the Sendwave team reviewing requests promptly.

Keep in mind that some countries enforce their own transfer rules. For example, transfers to Thailand are capped at 50,000 THB per transaction due to local regulations.

You can always check exact fees, exchange rates, and your sending limits within the app. This clarity ensures you know what your recipient will receive, allowing you to plan your transfers with confidence.
