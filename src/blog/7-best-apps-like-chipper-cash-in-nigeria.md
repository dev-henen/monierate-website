If you are looking for apps like Chipper Cash, but with better exchange rates, cheaper virtual cards, more currencies, and the ability to receive foreign currencies into your bank account, then read on.

Here are some of the problems I found with Chipper Cash:

-   The [exchange rates](https://monierate.com/ng/compare/providers/chippercash-exchange-rates) on Chipper Cash are higher than most other international money transfer apps in Nigeria.
-   The virtual cards on Chipper Cash are expensive.
-   No provision for foreign bank accounts.
-   The fees for creating virtual cards on Chipper Cash are high.
-   Chipper Cash only supports two currencies: NGN and USD.

If you are looking for an app that solves any of these problems, then there are a few alternatives to Chipper Cash that you may want to consider.

I will go into more detail about each of these apps and how they compare to Chipper Cash in this post.

## Top 7 Alternatives to Chipper Cash in Nigeria

### 1. Grey Finance
Grey Finance is a good app for sending and receiving money internationally and for holding multiple currencies.

**Grey has better exchange rates than Chipper Cash. For example, at the time of writing this post, if you exchange [NGN to USD](https://monierate.com/converter/grey?Amount=1&From=USD&To=NGN) on Grey, you will pay N934 for every $1. On Chipper Cash, you will only pay N964 for every $1. This means that you will save N30 for every $1 you buy on Grey.**

If you exchange NGN to USD for $3,000 on Grey, you will save N90,000. That's a lot of money!

**Here are some of the benefits of using Grey:**
