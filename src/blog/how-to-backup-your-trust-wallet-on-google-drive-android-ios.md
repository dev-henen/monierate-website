I recently backup my Trust Wallet account on Google Drive. In this article, you will learn exactly how you can backup your own Trust Wallet keys using Google Drive.

Having a backup allows you to access your crypto wallet in the case of a missing device or missing key phrases. A backup private key can be your saving grace. With it, you can restore your crypto wallet on a new device and avoid the pain of losses.



**Before you begin the backup process:**

- Ensure you have the updated Trust Wallet app downloaded on your mobile device.

- If you can't remember your Google Account password or your Google Account password is not strong enough then now is the right time to change your password to a strong and unique password.



**There are several ways you can back up your wallet:**



1. You can back up your Trust Wallet by writing the recovery phrase in a paper and keeping it in a hidden and secure place.

2. You can back up your recovery phrase on a flash drive or CD.

3. You can back up your wallet using Google Drive.





*You can find your secret keys within the "Backup" or "Security" settings. Write them down carefully on a piece of paper and store it in a secure, fireproof location.*



The focus of this article is on step **#3**. If you plan on backing up your wallet using Google Drive, below are the steps you should follow.

#### How to protect your Trust Wallet

- **Avoid Third-Party Connections:** Connecting your Trust Wallet to any third-party site, even trusted ones, increases your vulnerability to phishing scams. This is especially important for iOS users who might use Wallet Connect.

- **Enable DApp Browser (Optional):** If you frequently interact with decentralized applications (DApps), consider enabling the built-in Trust Wallet DApp browser. Simply open Safari and visit ***"trust://browser_enable."*** A pop-up will appear, asking to open the page in Trust Wallet. Select "Open" to activate the browser.



#### Troubleshooting tip on Trust Wallet

Some users have encountered permission errors during the backup process. If you face issues like "permission not allowed" or "update permission," try uninstalling and reinstalling the Trust Wallet app.
