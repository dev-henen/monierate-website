In 2022 alone, businesses made over[ $150 trillion in B2B cross-border payments](https://www.statista.com/statistics/609723/value-of-cross-border-payments-by-type/). With staggering numbers like that, it’s no surprise that cross-border trade is top of mind for businesses looking to scale and diversify their revenue.

However, cross-border payments present significant challenges. Businesses often face complex regulatory processes, lengthy settlement times, and unexpected fees, making international transactions a daunting prospect.

That’s not to downplay how far cross-border payments have evolved. Today, they’re faster, smarter and more accessible than ever. But for your business to truly benefit, you need to understand what it takes to[ pay a supplier in China](https://www.cedar.money/news-updates/how-to-pay-your-chinese-suppliers-from-africa), receive funds from a client in the UK, or manage payroll across Africa.

In this article, we’ll walk you through the nuts and bolts of cross-border payments: the methods, common use cases, benefits, and how to streamline it all. If your business is looking to scale globally, this guide is your starting point.


## **What are Cross-border Payments?**

Cross-border payments facilitate the international transfer of funds or assets between individuals and businesses located in different countries. These transactions, typically processed via banks or other financial platforms, are fundamental to various global activities, including international trade, remote work, and supply chains.

These payments are used by:

- Businesses paying suppliers, partners, or employees in other countries

- Freelancers and remote teams getting paid across borders

- Exporters and importers managing international transactions

As more businesses look to scale and expand beyond their local markets, it has become critical to their growth that they be able to move money in multiple currencies across borders quickly and securely. But without[ efficient cross-border payment practices](https://www.cedar.money/news-updates/5-best-practices-for-efficient-cross-border-payments), that same growth can quickly get weighed down by delays, fees, and operational strain.


## **How Does Cross-Border Payments Work?**

### Cross-border transactions may appear simple—entering recipient details and an amount before hitting send. However, a complex process unfolds behind the scenes to ensure funds are moved safely and compliantly between countries.

### **Behind-the-Scenes of a Cross-Border Transaction**

Every cross-border payment typically goes through a few critical layers:

1. **Initiation**: The payer (sender) initiates the transaction through their bank or a payment service provider (PSP). They provide details like the amount, currency, recipient’s bank information and account number.

- **Intermediary Network**: If the sender’s and recipient’s banks don’t have a direct relationship, one or more correspondent banks help bridge the gap.

- **Currency Conversion**: If the transaction involves different currencies, an FX provider converts the funds, often applying a spread or fee.

2. **Transfer**: The sender’s bank or PSP sends the payment information to the recipient’s bank. This often involves the SWIFT network, which acts as a messaging system for international bank transfers. However, if the sender’s and recipient’s banks don’t have a direct relationship, the payment may be routed through one or more correspondent banks.

_Correspondent banks enable international payments between two banks that don't have a direct relationship. These banks serve as intermediaries, offering pathways to global financial networks and enabling transactions across various currencies and jurisdictions._

3. **Clearing and Settlement**: The payment is cleared (verified and matched) and settled (funds are transferred between banks), which can take anywhere from minutes to days depending on the payment corridor. When the payer and receiver use different currencies, the payment process may involve a currency conversion. Once settled, the recipient's bank deposits the funds in the recipient's account.


### **Key Stakeholders Involved in a Cross-Border Transaction**

1. **Sender**: The party (individual or business) who initiates the payment.

2. **Recipient**: The party who receives the funds.

3. **Banks**: Both the sender’s and recipient’s banks, and often, correspondent banks.

4. **Payment Service Providers (PSPs)**: Fintechs or platforms like Cedar Money that simplify the process by offering faster routing, compliance automation, and better rates.


### **The Compliance Aspect**

Cross-border payments are closely monitored due to anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorist financing (CTF), and sanctions regulations. These transactions are frequently screened against global compliance standards, often at multiple points in the payment process. This necessary attention to detail can slow things down or flag issues if not carefully managed.

That’s why businesses making cross-border payments need partners that are capable of automating these checks efficiently, without compromising speed or a positive user experience. Cedar, for example, offers[ multi-factor authentication](https://www.cedar.money/news-updates/how-cedar-money-protects-your-business-with-multi-factor-authentication) and other enterprise-grade security features to keep payments secure, while also[ simplifying the entire cross-border transaction process](https://www.cedar.money/news-updates/simplify-cross-border-payments-with-secure-transactions) from initiation to settlement.


## **Common Ways to Send and Receive Money Internationally**

When it comes to moving money across borders, there are quite a number of options available, each with its own pros, cons and use cases. Choosing the best cross-border payment method for any transaction depends on several factors: the amount to be transferred, the payment corridor (i.e., the originating and receiving countries), the currencies involved, and the associated fees, which can vary between providers and methods.

**These are the most common ways to make cross-border payments:**

1. **Wire Transfers:** This is the more traditional, well-established, and widely accepted method for sending funds internationally. It involves the electronic movement of funds from one bank account to another. Wire transfers are a go-to for many businesses, particularly when dealing with high-volume transactions. However, they can be quite costly, especially when routed through multiple correspondent banks.

2. **2. Electronic Fund Transfers (EFTs):** This is a broad term for any transfer of funds initiated electronically between accounts, utilising methods like SWIFT, Fedwire or other systems.  Some types of EFTs include ACH payment or ACH direct deposits, Credit card or debit card transactions, peer-to-peer payments and even wire transfers. _All wire transfers are EFTs, but not all EFTs are wire transfers._

3. **Digital Wallets and Fintech Platforms:** Modern platforms like Cedar Money are redefining how businesses make cross-border payments. With faster processing and settlement times, transparent fees, and user-friendly dashboards, fintechs offer a more flexible experience. They often support multiple currencies and payout options, making them ideal for businesses that need to move fast and efficiently.

4. **Card Payments:** Debit and credit card payments can be convenient for smaller, one-off international purchases, think SaaS subscriptions or travel expenses. But for B2B transfers or high-volume transactions, they often come with high interchange fees, limited payout control, and stricter usage caps.

5. **Cryptocurrency:** Crypto offers speed, transparency, and low fees, making it appealing for some startups and freelancers. However, adoption remains uneven, and regulatory uncertainty can pose risks for businesses. Cedar doesn’t currently support crypto, but it’s an area many fintechs are watching closely.

For both businesses engaged in international trade and individuals sending or receiving funds across borders, a thorough evaluation of the available payment solutions is paramount. This careful consideration ensures the selection of a method that not only aligns with their specific financial requirements but also optimises for speed, cost-effectiveness, security, and convenience. Understanding the nuances of each option empowers users to navigate the complexities of international payments efficiently and effectively.


## **How Businesses Use Cross-Border Payments**

Cross-border payments are the engine behind countless business operations. Here’s how they show up in real-world scenarios:

1. **Paying International Suppliers and Freelancers:** Whether you're sourcing materials from Asia or working with a designer in Canada, businesses need a fast, reliable way to pay overseas vendors. Delays or errors here can strain relationships and slow down production.

2. **Receiving Customer Payments from Abroad:** Cross-border payments don’t just go out, they come in, too. E-commerce brands, B2B services, and exporters need infrastructure to accept payments from customers in other currencies and countries. The easier it is to pay you, the faster your global business can grow.

3. **Cross-Border Payroll for Remote Teams:** With distributed teams becoming the norm, businesses need seamless ways to run payroll across multiple countries. Ensuring employees and contractors are paid accurately and on time (in their local currency) is a must.

4. **Settling Marketplace Earnings:** If you sell on global marketplaces like Amazon, Etsy, or Upwork, your earnings often come in different currencies. Managing payouts across platforms and countries can get complex unless you have a centralised solution.

5. **Paying for B2B SaaS or International Services:** Think email platforms, cloud hosting, legal support, or marketing consultants. Businesses frequently rely on international services and tools, and having an efficient payment method simplifies vendor relationships.


## **Benefits and Limitations of Cross-Border Payments**

No payment method is perfect. Here’s what to expect when dealing with international transfers:


### **Benefits**

- **Wider Reach**: You’re not limited by geography. Tap into talent, customers, and markets around the world.

- **Process Efficiency**: Modern platforms offer automation, API integrations, and dashboards that help reduce manual errors and administrative overhead.

## **How to Make a Cross-Border Payment (Step-by-Step)**

If your business is sending or receiving money internationally, here’s a clear process to follow:

1. **Choose a Payment Provider**\
   Look for one that supports the currencies and countries you operate in, offers favourable rates, and meets your speed and compliance needs. _For instance,_ **_Cedar Money_** _enables businesses to send over 30 million dollars daily to other businesses in over 190 countries around the world and receive from 9 major African markets._

2. **Check the Exchange Rate**: Understand how much your recipient will receive and how much the transaction will really cost after FX spreads and fees.

3. **Add Recipient’s Details**: This includes the recipient’s name, account number, bank name, SWIFT code (or local equivalent), and address.

4. **Verify and send the Payment**: Review all the information carefully. A small error (like a typo in the account number) can delay or bounce the transfer.

5. **Track the Payment:** Depending on your chosen provider, check to see the status of your transactions to know if it has been delivered to your recipient. Modern providers like Cedar Money let you follow the payment in real-time with updates at every stage, no need for “just checking in” emails.

6. **Confirm Arrival**: Make sure the recipient receives the funds in full. Some platforms (like Cedar) generate payout confirmations to help you document the arrival and build trust with partners.
