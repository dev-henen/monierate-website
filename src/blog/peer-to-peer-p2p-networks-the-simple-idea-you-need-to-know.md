Living in this tech age, you surely have heard of networking. It is a social term that relates to meeting/communicating with people within a specialized niche. More specifically, it means maintaining a meaningful relationship within this context.

Computers, like humans, also make use of networks. This is important considering the vast and versatile nature of present-day ICT.

So what do these networks do? They form the channel through which computers interact with each other. 

Raw data and processed information are passed over a network. Similarly, networks provide support for resource allocation/sharing. 

## What is a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network?

A peer-to-peer network is a network where each node acts both as a client and server. This resource-sharing configuration functions without a central server. Basically, it eliminates the need for a single database, server, or control software.

## Understanding a Peer-to-Peer Network

#### First, the traditional networks

The Internet is a solid example of a traditional network. Launched in the 90’s, it is now a standard for resource availability and sharing. However, the Internet is a server-based network.

Its architecture revolves around the use of servers.

Servers are physical systems that service (provide) other computers with information or resources. They are spread across different locations.

People upload their resources and data to the server. In turn, others download resources and data from the server. This is how the network operates.

  

Ideally, the server serves as a backbone. Take it out of the network and the entire setup ceases to operate.

#### Now, a Peer-to-Peer Network

A peer-to-peer network works in reverse. Or, more precisely, it works differently.

The network is run without the critical server infrastructure. This means every participating computer serves the function of a storage or server. Resources are moved directly to and from a computer’s memory.

Using this system, there’s no need to have information uploaded to a third party from which uploads and downloads are made. Instead, participating computers send and receive data to/from their peers.

This direct resource-sharing relationship inspired the unique name of this network.

## Implementing a Peer-to-Peer Network

A peer-to-peer (P2P) network is similar to a traditional network. That is in terms of implementation. Peer-to-peer networks can be implemented either physically or virtually.

#### Physical Peer-to-Peer Network Setup

Physical implementation involves connecting the entire network using visible connectors. The form of connection here is really important. Also relevant is the type of connectors used.

Connection form and connector type determine a number of things. For example, the reliability of the network. If the network is ring-shaped, each computer between a source and a receiver is involved in resource-sharing.

However, if the connection is star-shaped, participants communicate better. In this case, they don’t have to rely on other computers except the source.

Now you understand why connection form is important, So how about the type of connector used?

Connector types go a long way to impact data transmission. Advanced connectors allow large high-volume data to pass through. Older connectors might not meet this standard. Some may allow large-size files but impair the data quality. Others may only support small data sizes.

#### Virtual Peer-to-Peer Network Setup

A virtual peer-to-peer network is set up remotely. Computers don’t have to exist within a physical location. They also don’t need any wires or cable connectors. The entire connection is seamless.

## Advantages of a Peer-to-Peer Network Over a Traditional Network

For clarity, we should describe a traditional network. This refers to a system of computers connected through a server. Server-based networks have dominated the IT/tech scene.

Now, down to the advantages of a peer-to-peer network over the traditional.

#### Lower Cost

Cost is one of the major highlights here. Imagine buying and installing a server with all its software and licenses. Then, think of the simplicity of setting up a router.

That’s not all. Managing and maintaining a server requires technical support. Getting this service can be expensive. A bigger problem arises when you have to do so frequently.

On the contrary, p2p networks do not present such a burden. That is because network participants only need to worry about their PCs.

#### Fewer Licenses and Software

We mentioned something related to this just above. Server networks operate off multiple licenses - and software. Putting this together might take days, weeks or months.

The case is much different with p2p networks. The network elements (personal computers) depend on fewer licenses - at least. These are easier to come by.

#### Faster Setup and Launch

P2P networks beat traditional in terms of cost and license/software requirements. What does this tell you? Simply. It is easier to set up and launch the former.

#### Scalability:

Scalability focuses on growth/expansion. In the case of a network, it refers to successful support for increased users and their demands or activities.

P2P networks take the trophy for this. These simple constructs can easily accommodate new nodes/participants. They also do so at an impressive speed.

A server network can also be scaled. There are just a few problems. Most time, scaling a server network means adding more servers.

Think of skyrocketing costs, increased technicality, and possible network downtimes.

## Pros and Cons of a P2P Network

In the previous section, we put P2P networks up against traditional networks. In this one, we will consider the pros and cons of a P2P network itself.

With all the seeming upsides, p2p networks also come it some drawbacks. This section aims to explain the pros and cons of a peer-to-peer network.

#### Pros of a P2P Network

The pros of a P2P network are the same as the advantages. Being so, the section above effectively covers this subsection.

#### Cons of a P2P Network

-   Security

If you’re thinking security, you might want to go for a server network. The presence of a server acts like a checkpoint. It scrutinises data that is being shared.

Servers can check for vulnerabilities or malicious data. This keeps shared resources clean, protecting computers within the network.

In addition, servers can be used to implement policies. A policy might be used to enforce safe or high-quality data, among other things.

-   Data Integrity or Reliability

How do you tell that data you download from a peer computer is up-to-date? Could a different peer computer hold a more recent file or a higher-version software?

These are some possibilities that make P2P networks unfavourable.

## Examples of a Peer-to-Peer Network

-   WhatsApp:

Perhaps you haven’t thought about it but WhatsApp is a peer-to-peer network. Why is this so?

Remember seeing alerts about messages being end-to-end encrypted? Well, that’s because the platform operates without a server. Messages, documents, audio, are moved directly from the sender to the receiver.

Ideally, the conversations are encrypted at the sender’s end. After transmission, they are decrypted at the receiver’s end.

networks

-   Skype:

Skype utilises a P2P-type network for audio and video messages.

## Conclusion

The P2P network is a breakthrough where computer networks and connectivity is concerned. This network type is less sophisticated but more efficient than the contemporary.
