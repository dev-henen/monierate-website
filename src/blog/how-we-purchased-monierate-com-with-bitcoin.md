I wanted to title this article, "How to buy a domain with Bitcoin for less than $3". However, I feel it is important to tell a practical story. The domain [monierate.com](http://monierate.com/) is a practical story.  
  
In the [last](https://monierate.com/blog/virtualcard/how-i-came-up-with-the-name-monierate-com) post, I shared how we came up with the domain. Well, one interesting thing I didn't mention was how we purchased the domain with Bitcoin for less than $3.

Come with me.

### Necessity is the mother of discovery
As a team, our approach is to build a simple tool that will require very little capital to run. So every decision has to be based on a tight budget.

### Choosing a name

I already explained how we came up with the name Monierate in the last post, and how the goal was to get a .COM TLD. The problem was, .COM domains cost $8 - $20 on the internet.

**Is there a way I can get it for free?**

### Finding the cheapest registrar

I have purchased most of my domains on Namecheap. But this time, I was thinking about the price. A .COM domain on Namecheap cost about $10 for existing customers.  
  
$10 is fair, but on a budget mindset, you ask yourself, "Can I get it free or cheap?"  
  
So I googled "Cheapest .COM domain registrars".  
  
From the search result, I discovered a tool called [tld-list.com](https://tld-list.com/tld/com). Tld-list is a domain price comparison tool, similar to [Monierate.com](http://monierate.com/) but for domain prices.

On the tld-list page, I found a list of registrars for .COM domains with their prices displayed alongside other information like payment options and coupon codes.  
  
The first(lowest) price on the list was $2.89 from a registrar called Spaceship and they accept Bitcoin.

> If you are based in Nigeria, you know how terrible and expensive it is to pay with a bank card. Nigerian cards are frequently rejected by international payment processors. As a Bitcoin native, seeing that Bitcoin is accepted on Spaceship made the purchase process stress-free.

### Paying with Bitcoin

I immediately hop on to the Spaceship website by clicking the link on the tld-list page. Added [monierate.com](http://monierate.com/) to my cart, pasted the coupon code which I copied from the TDLR-LIST website, and proceeded.  
  
I was asked to choose a payment method, I selected Account Fund. Funded the Account Fund with Bitcoin from my Muun App. And in less than 60 seconds, the purchase of [Monierate.com](http://monierate.com/) was successful.

> Spaceship has an account wallet that you can fund with Bitcoin, you can they use the funds on your wallet to pay for domains.

The total amount paid was $2.98 including Bitcoin Lightning fees (1 SAT) ðŸ˜…...surreal.

If I had used a virtual card to purchase the domain, it should have been more than that.

### Conclusion

So many things we pay for are not necessary, even the necessary ones like hosting and domains, we can save 50% of the original amount by being a little frugal and doing some Google search.  
  
I used to pay $20 for a Cron Job service, but last year, I discovered a free Cron Job tool and funny enough it works better than the $20 tool I was using.  
  
Next time you want to buy a domain, go to [tld-list.com](https://tld-list.com/tld/com) and compare prices. I suggest you look for a registrar that accepts Bitcoin as paying with Bitcoin is cheaper than cards.

I pray we all make it.
