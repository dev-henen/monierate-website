The use of USDT for crypto trading will be especially alluring to investors and traders from countries with high inflation rates, and Nigeria is one of them. The stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, has gained traction among financially savvy Nigerians who value USDT for its ability to protect their purchasing power from the depreciating Naira and to simplify cross-border transactions – just like you would use actual dollar if it were readily accessible.



All you need to do is find a trustworthy platform to convert your Naira-denominated savings into USDT. You can purchase USDT from your mobile phone using NGN through a peer-to-peer (p2p) marketplace on cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Bybit, using the familiar bank transfer method.

In this direct transaction, the buyer sends funds to the seller’s bank account, completely avoiding the delays and expenses of network fees typically incurred before trading can commence.



But what apps are the best? To aid you in this journey, we’ve curated a list of the top 5 apps that you can use to buy USDT using the trusted bank transfer method.
