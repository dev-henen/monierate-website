In Nigeria, you will require a P2P service to purchase digital assets like USDT with a fiat currency and the Bybit mobile app is one of the innovative platforms bridging the gap, as you can trade directly from your Android device.

According to data from [Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/), Bybit is ranked number 3 by trade volume on the spot market. It supports over 40 fiat currencies and boasts 300+ payment methods to provide unparalleled flexibility and choice for its users.

In this article, we’ll take you through the step-by-step process of depositing USDT using the Bybit Android App.


## Before buying USDT on Bybit
Here are two things you should consider before depositing USDT into your Bybit wallet:

1. You must have created a [Bybit account](https://www.bybit.com/en/promo/global/p2p-introduce/) and completed the necessary KYC verification processes. Thankfully, you can now use your Bank Verification Number (BVN) for a simpler identity verification process.

2. When making the fiat payment from your Nigerian bank account, avoid using any crypto-related terms in the transaction description or narration.

By following these simple steps, you can ensure a smooth and successful USDT deposit into your Bybit wallet.
