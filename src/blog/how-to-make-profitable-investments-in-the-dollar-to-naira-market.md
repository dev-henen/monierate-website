Economic indicators are statistical data used to assess and measure the overall health and performance of an economy. Always measure and compare the performance of the Nigerian and US economy.

Interest rates are the cost of borrowing money or the return earned on savings or investments. When interest rates are low, there may be an improvement in economic indicators, but it may lead to inflation.

Pay attention to geopolitical events. Negative events like crises, wars, trade disputes, and the crash of oil prices may impact the dollar to naira market. Positive events like increases in oil prices, robust GDP growth, and stronger foreign reserves can strengthen the naira against the dollar.

Analyze the supply and demand of dollar and naira and their impact on the market. If there is a higher demand for dollars, expect a fall in Naira, the converse is also true. You can gain insights into the historical performance and trends of the market to identify potential investment opportunities.

Learn how to analyze economic data, government policies, and global events to make informed investment decisions.

Read books such as "Fundamental Analysis For Dummies" by Matt Krantz. Take online courses on sites such as Investopedia, Udemy or Coursera. Get a mentor to guide you in the process and network with other traders. Stay up to date on the financial websites mentioned above.

These will help you develop a strong foundation in fundamental analysis and enhance your ability to evaluate the intrinsic value of securities, make informed investment decisions, and navigate the financial markets effectively.

## 3. Employ Risk Management Techniques

Mellody Hobson said, "The biggest risk of all, is not taking one.". However, the one risk you decided to take may never allow you to take another risk, you may be wiped out of the market. The secret to profitable investment no one may have told you is **staying the longest in the market**. Time in the market is key, so "never lose money", in other words, never run out of money to invest.

## 4. Choose the Right Investment Strategy

Many new investors consider only one strategy before making an investment. Wanna be Warren Buffet will go on Youtube and hear a "hot investment strategy" and begin investing.

Never do that!

One investment strategy is not enough to consider when starting out. You need to consider several investment strategies based on how much you have, your investment goal, and what you can afford to lose in case things go bad.

For example, a popular investment strategy is Dollar Cost Averaging, a process of investing chunks in an asset at an interval time over a long time. But for this strategy to work you need to consider the underlying asset, the money you have, your investment goal, and how much can you lose. Using this strategy to invest naira in dollars may work, but if you don't have enough money on a regular to continue investing for several months or maybe years, you may not reap much return or achieve your investment goal.

Long-term investors may focus on position trading, holding investments for an extended period to benefit from long-term trends. Short-term investors may prefer swing trading or day trading to take advantage of short-term price fluctuations. Know yourself and what you have, then align your investment strategy with your goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance.

## 5. Utilize Technical Analysis

This is not for every investor. Mostly for short-term investors and day traders.

Technical analysis involves studying charts and price patterns to identify trends and forecast future price movements.

Learn how to use technical indicators, trend lines, and chart patterns to make investment decisions. Understand support and resistance levels and use them to identify points to invest and point to exit.

Develop a trading strategy based on technical analysis to maximize investment profitability.
