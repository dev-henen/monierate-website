## Cleva USD Account Fees

|-|-|-|
| Fees | ACH Transaction| Wire Transactions |  
|US Banks | Yes | Yes |
| Non-US Banks | No | Yes | 
| Fixed Fee Percent | 0.9% | 0.9% |
| Minimum Chargeable Fee | $1.5 | $10 |

#### Fee for ACH transactions:

All US banks can perform ACH transactions. Also, payments from remote workplaces like Upwork are made as ACH.

For transactions of this nature, Cleva maintains a charge of 0.9%. The minimum chargeable fee is $1.5. On the flip side, the maximum chargeable fee is $20.

#### Fee for Wire transactions:

All non-US banks are restricted to wire transactions. At the same time, US banks can perform this type of transactions too. The interesting thing with this is it is a more expensive means of transfer.

This is evident in the increased minimum chargeable fee of $10.

It is important to note that Cleva only charges deposit fee. Senders do not have to worry about paying a dime. However, they may want to consider adding some extra amounts since recievers are charged a [fee](https://monierate.com/blog/what-is-fees-and-what-you-need-to-know-about-it). This reduces the final amount the receiver gets.

There’s a standard contact email for support and enquiries. This can be found at the bottom of the Cleva website. The company also sports a presence on the most popular social media.

You can find them on Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram.

## Security Features

Cleva is dedicated to filling the gaps left by contemporary payment solutions. One of the ways it accomplishes this is by beefing up its platform security. Here’s what to know about the security features of Cleva.

#### Partnership with Licensed and Compliant Bodies:

The Cleva team is properly registered. It is also well trained to function in its current capacity as a payment solution.

Cleva is registered as a Money Service Business (MSB). This registration is with the United States’ Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Its financial partners are licensed US-based companies, helping to facilitate a seamless customer experience.

#### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and PIN:

Customers must exercise due diligence when using fintech platforms like Cleva. In this case, that involves setting up proper account security. Meeting this requirement passes the baton on to the platform, ensuring rounded protection of the customer’s interest.

-   **Two-Factor Authentication**: 2FA is a highly effective security measure. However, Cleva users are not mandated to activate it in their accounts before signin. The 2FA security feature works with common apps like Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.

-   **PIN**: In addition to the 2FA feature, there’s the option of good old-fashioned PIN. Users can set a PIN for their account and remove it at any time. When set, PIN will be used for authorizing transactions.

## Pros and Cons of Cleva

You surely want to know the great and not so great things about Cleva.

#### Pros

- Capped maximum fee (deposits)
- Zero conversion fee
- Instant Card Issuance

One of the upsides to using Cleva is that their deposit fee has a capped upper-limit. Essentially, you won’t be charged beyond this amount when making a large transaction.

Certain other fintech charge a fee for converting/exchanging USD to any other currency. This does not apply on Cleva.

Cleva also allows for instant creation of virtual USD cards. Once created, the card is immediately issued to the customer. This process is much faster than with physical USD cards.

#### Cons

- Capped minimum fee ($10 for Wire Transfers):

A capped minimum fee does not favor very low-value transactions. Imagine receiving an ACH transfer of $5 and paying a deposit fee of $1.5.

## Alternatives Worth Considering

Cleva is a top pick for anyone looking to get a USD account. However, there are always going to be competitors in such a market. In this section, we highlight platforms that can serve as an alternative.

- **Geegpay**: [Geegpay](https://www.geegpay.africa/) was founded in 2022. Today, the platform has improved considerably. It is also garnering significant popularity among the Nigerian and African remote workforce.

- **Grey**: [Grey](https://grey.co/) is another option for accessing a USD account. The platform launched in June 2020. In July 2021, it went a step further by launching virtual international bank accounts. The platform operates around providing inclusive global banking.

- **Chipper Cash**: [Chipper Cash](https://www.chippercash.com/) is the oldest of these alternatives. Founded in 2018, the platform now serves over five million customers. Chipper was developed with Africa in mind, to provide trusted and accessible financial services.

## Final Thoughts

Let’s start with the fees-which is what almost every user considers first. Cleva earns a good point for using a percentage-based fee system. This, typically, means that fees reduce with lower transfer amounts and increase correspondingly.

But that’s the theory of it.

In reality, setting a minimum chargeable fee turns things around. It means that no matter the transfer amount, fees will not go below a certain point. This is disadvantageous for people transacting low amounts of money.

Another thing we want to speak on is Cleva’s popularity. Of course, traffic is one of the ways to make this judgment, as it almost directly indicates user interest.

Traffic occurs in the form of website visits, app downloads and the like. Having said that, here’s what we find about Cleva.

Their website [reportedly](https://www.similarweb.com/website/getcleva.com/) received 141.3k visits in September. Of these visits, 79.47% appears to be from Nigeria, with 11.16% from the US, 6.91% from the UK, and the remainder 2.46% from a number of other countries.

The Cleva app on Apple Store records 104 downloads. The same app on Google PlayStore records 100k+ downloads. This shows an impressive record of users for a platform that is relatively new.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Yes. USD account owners on Cleva cannot receive less than $1.5. It may be recommended to keep all deposits above this value.

## Conclusion
