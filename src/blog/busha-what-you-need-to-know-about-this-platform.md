![Busha: What You Need to Know About This Platform](https://ik.imagekit.io/monierate/Blog/product/busha_the_apple_of_crypto_in_africa.webp?updatedAt=1749734057983)

Busha is a platform that has emerged as a major player in making cryptocurrency accessible, understandable, and usable for individuals and businesses in Nigeria and  Africa at large, particularly in Nigeria and Kenya.

## What is Cryptocurrency?

Simply put, Cryptocurrencies are digital assets, most often based on blockchain technology, and they can also be termed as digital or virtual money secured by cryptography.

Unlike traditional currencies issued by central banks (Naira, Dollar, Pounds, Euros and many others), cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin operate on decentralised systems, that is, a single entity does not control them.

This system offers a global, borderless means of transaction, potentially with lower fees and faster processing times than the normal way of banking. Bitcoin (BTC) is the pioneering and most well-known cryptocurrency, but thousands of others now exist, like Ethereum (ETH), Tether USD (USDT) and several others.

So, how does Busha help in making cryptocurrency offerings to Nigerians and Africans easy?

Founded to address the challenges faced by Africans in accessing the global cryptocurrency market, Busha provides a trusted and user-friendly platform (Android, iOS & Web) to buy, sell, swap, spend, earn and save several cryptocurrencies.

It was established when many global crypto platforms were not optimally designed for the African market, offering a solution tailored for you in mind.
