The previous week saw the closure of a virtual card provider's service, causing the disabling of card services in about 90% of virtual card applications such as Chippercash, Payday, Wirepay, CoinProfile, BitNob, and Eversend.

Some of these apps like Payday and Wirepay were among our April recommendations, and some of you already started using them.

We apologize, but the issue is outside of our control. Many of these card applications depend on a key provider, which means that any disruption in their services will have an impact on the card service.

> A Provider is a bank, fintech, or financial institution in Nigeria or abroad that enable businesses to provide virtual cards for their customers.

## Which card would you like us to recommend now?

Before we send out our next recommendations, we came across a virtual card application that would enable you to resume making online payments.

### Gotok

Gotok is an app that allows you to create up to ten virtual cards. Unlike other card applications, it has a straightforward interface and provides virtual cards with clear usage, without any complex features.

#### Fees

Card creation is free, there are no transaction fees when using the card. You can freely fund your card via naira bank transfer at relatively good rates.

For those who are well-versed in cryptocurrency like myself, you may prefer to fund your card using cryptocurrency, though with a 1% processing fee.

#### Limit

Card balance:

**(min: $1 max: $10,000)**

Daily Funding Limit: **$5,000**

Monthly Funding Limit: **$100,000**

Daily Withdrawal Limit: **$5,000**

Monthly Withdrawal Limit: **$100,000**

**You can create up to 10 cards.**

> TC: You need to have at least $1 on your card. You can not withdraw this $1, but you can spend it.

Works perfectly on AliExpress, Amazon and over 60 million sites.

Compare the 24-hour dollar rate of Gotok on [Monierate.com](http://monierate.com/).

## Update from Chippercash and Payday

Chippercash and Payday have promptly responded by introducing new virtual cards. However, unlike their previous cards, these new ones are not free to create.

The cost of creating a Chippercash card is N2,000, while Payday's card is priced at $5 (approximately N3865 according to Monierate.com) for both Mastercard and Visa options.
