## What is the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)?



CBN, or the Central Bank of Nigeria, is the apex banking institution in Nigeria. As the name implies, it is central to all activities in the banking and financial sector. The CBN oversees the control and administration of monetary and other related policies on behalf of the federal government.



## The CBN Act of 2007



Nigeria’s apex bank operates under the CBN Act of 2007, originally started as the 1958 Act of Parliament.



The 1958 Act of Parliament contained a draft legislation that proposed a central bank. The House of Assembly which was existent at the time, received this draft in March of 1958, reviewed it and accepted it. Their actions became the first major step towards the centralization of banking operations in Nigeria.



The 1958 Act of Parliament has been amended several times since its inception. First was in 1991. Next was two years later in 1993. After the 1993 amendment, another four alterations were made to the CBN Act.



Three of them occurred consecutively in 1997, 1998 and 1999. The last and most recent amendment was made in 2007.

Today, the Central Bank of Nigeria comprises a whooping 29 departments. That’s what it takes to lead a banking system utilized by more than 200 million Nigerians.



Its complex organogram is led at the very top by an 11-man Board of Directors. The board interacts with stakeholders and translates their interests and values. It also evaluates competent management and monitors the operations of the institution.



While the Board of Directors sit as an overwatch, it is the CBN governor who runs the processes and activities within the apex bank.



Six out of twenty-nine CBN departments are under the direct watch of the CBN governor. They include the governor’s department, as well as the risk management, corporate secretariat, development finance, strategy management, and internal audit offices.  



The other twenty-three departments are spread under four lead departments, all overseen by the CBN deputy governor. Now, it would be impossible for the deputy governor alone to track and process requests and activities from all twenty-three departments under his watch.



That’s why every single department within the CBN has a department head who reports to either the CBN deputy governor or the governor himself.



## History of CBN  



**The CBN has a long history**. Most of it details turning point activities that helped shape the Nigerian finance and banking industry. In this section, we handpick important timelines and events triggered by the CBN or in which they played a critical role.



**1959**

When it launched, Nigeria’s central bank consisted of only two departments. These were the General Manager’s department and the Secretary’s department. The former took care of banking, currency issues, debt management and other related matters. The latter was in charge of administration and staff management.



Lagos State served as the headquarters of the Central Bank of Nigeria when it began operations in 1959. However, the institution is now headquartered in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory.



**1962**

The first branch of the Central Bank of Nigeria was open for business in Kano State. This was the second CBN office to be established.



**1970**

A new organizational structure was proposed for the CBN. The size of departments were reviewed in this action.



**1991**

The CBN became the sole authority for the supervision and licensing of banks. Previously, the CBN and the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF) both shared this daunting role.



## CBN Exchange Rate

CBN exchange rate may be referred to as the official CBN statement of how the Naira is trading against any particular foreign currency.



Typically, the CBN tracks and officially reports exchange rate information on several currency pairs where the naira is the base currency. A long list of trading pairs are always analyzed. However, the most popular are the [NGN/USD](https://monierate.com/converter/cbn/?Amount=1&From=USD&To=NGN), NGN/GBP, and NGN/EUR pairs.



These three pairs put the Naira up against the U.S dollar, the Great British Pound, and the Euro respectively.



## Other Duties of the Central Bank of Nigeria



The Central Bank of Nigeria is not called a central bank for nothing. As we will see in this section, the institution is in charge of some very critical tasks.



These tasks or duties are critical because they impact the general Nigerian populace in one way or another. For example, the CBN provides services and policies that directly or indirectly affects individuals. Secondly, and more importantly, its duties go a long way in influencing the state of the economy, which could make the entire population richer or poorer.  



Now, having briefly explored the significance of the CBN’s duties, let’s take a look at some of these really important tasks.



#### Ensure Monetary and Price Stability:

When the price of goods in the market is on the rise, be sure that the CBN is watching the incident. Central banks have that responsibility of ensuring monetary and price stability.



#### Issue Legal Tender Currency in Nigeria:

CBN not only decides what is legal tender or not but also controls the printing, issuing, and circulation of the Nigerian legal tender currency, Naira.



It exercised its power to do this when - against all odds - it began and implemented the 2022 naira redesign campaign.  



Also, the CBN historically released Nigeria’s very own banknotes on 1st July, 1959 to replace the West African Currency Board (WACB) banknotes and coins which were in use at the time. Six years later, it scrapped that and issued new currency banknotes that reflected the Country’s republican status.



On currency circulation, the apex bank closely monitors the amount of physical cash held by or available to the public.



This information is analyzed against prevailing economic situations or trends. If the need arises, the CBN may then choose to increase or reduce the volume of naira in circulation. This is effortlessly implemented through different mechanisms. Such action typically curbs inflation and restores economic balance.



#### Maintain External Reserves:



External reserves, also called International reserves, refer to external assets deposited, accessible, and fully controlled by a country’s financial or monetary authority.



As an apex bank, the CBN maintains Nigeria’s external reserves. The most recent figures [reveal](https://nairametrics.com/2024/05/09/nigerias-fx-reserves-reach-three-week-high-gain-262-million/#:~:text=The%20Central%20Bank%20of%20Nigeria's,month%20dip%20of%20%2432.107%20billion.) an asset value of $32.369 billion as of May 7, 2024.



Components of Nigeria’s external reserve are gold, the International Monetary Fund’s (IMFs) tranche, Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), and convertible currencies. By managing these assets overseas, the CBN plays a critical role in safeguarding the international value of the legal tender currency.



#### Promote a Sound Financial System in Nigeria:



Overall, the CBN works towards creating a sound financial system in Nigeria. It achieves this by monitoring and processing local and foreign market and economic data. It will then design and implement necessary actions to promote financial stability and growth.



Sub-level activities in regard to promoting a sound financial system includes consulting stakeholders and other financial authorities, drafting beneficial policies, ensuring compliance with regulations, combating financial crimes, and more.  



#### Act as Banker and Advisor:



The Central Bank of Nigeria also acts as a banker to the federal government, commercial banks, and other financial institutions (OFIs). What this means is that the apex bank is responsible for managing federal and enterprise accounts and processes.



For example, it operates the government’s account including managing salary payments, processing revenue and expenditures, and performing government debt servicing.



As an advisor, the CBN serves to provide economic and financial advice to the Federal Government.



## Conclusion



The CBN is a robust list of departments put together. All of these departments function towards the safety and progress of banking and finance within the country. Beginning operations in 1959, Nigeria’s apex bank has pursued rapid development of itself, the economy, and the working of its industry. Nevertheless, its strategies are sometimes considered controversial among the general populace.
