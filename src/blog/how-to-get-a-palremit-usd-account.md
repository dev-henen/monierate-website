**Card Creation Fee:** Creating a USD card on Palremit attracts a fee of $2. 

**USD Funding Fee:** Funding your USD card attracts a 2% charge. However, there's a catch with that. Palremit will only accept a minimum of $0.5 as fee payment for this activity. 

It means that funding $10 on your card should cost you $0.2. Instead, with the minimum charge in place, it will cost an extra $0.3 on top of that. 

**Card Deposit Fee:** A percentage-based fee is applied on Palremit card deposits small and considerable, standing at 1% only. 

**Card Monthly Maintenance Fee:** Note that card and account monthly maintenance are two different things. On Palremit, you pay a fee of $1 for card monthly maintenance. Thankfully, account maintenance is totally free.  

**Declined Low-balance Charge:** Virtual cards can be used for several online services or payments. In some situations, a card’s balance is insufficient for an intended payment. This results in a declined transaction.

Palremit charges this type of event. The fee amount is a fixed $0.3.

**USD Account Deletion Fee:** It seems even deleting your USD account isn't free. Funny thing is it costs a stunning $5.

## Steps in Getting a USD Account on Palremit

1.  **Download the Palremit Mobile App**: The Palremit service is only accessible through the mobile app. Visit the Google PlayStore or the Apple App Store to download the app on your Android or iOS devices respectively.

2.  **Create an Account**: This is the very first step. Click on the “Create Account” button to get started. Fill in your country, email, password, and referral code (optional). Next, read the Terms and Conditions at the bottom of the entry fields. Select the button to confirm your action. Click “Next” to proceed.

3.  **Verify Email and Onboard**: An OTP is sent to the email you provided. Copy-paste this code in the appropriate field. Once done, you get to an onboarding page. Personal details are required here. They include your first name, last name, gender, and phone.

4.  **Login to Dashboard**: After submitting your personal information, you are redirected to sign in. Enter your email and password to proceed. This will usher you to your Palremit dashboard, where you can take several actions.

5.  **Setup Transaction PIN**: A simple prompt appears on your dashboard screen. This reminds you to set up a transaction PIN. Feel free to use a PIN of four digits or longer.

6.  **Complete KYC process**: Next, you want to double down on your USD account creation. Begin by clicking the “View More” button. This is located just below the six action cards at the centre of the screen. A card of options opens, including one that says, “USD deposit”. Click on this and complete the three-part KYC process. This starts with a simple selfie and a request to provide your Bank Verification Number (BVN). If this checks out, you see the option to submit an additional identification document. You may choose to use your National Identification Number (NIN), driver’s license, or international passport for this. Note that, in all cases, you have to input the document number and upload a copy to the platform. The supported formats are JPG, JPEG, PNG, and PDF. Once uploaded, you will see a message saying, “We’ve got you.” Click the “Okay” button. Wait for an email confirmation.

7.  **Create Palremit USD Account**: Completing the previous step will usher you to a Palremit USD Account creation page. Click on “Create an Account”. Next, provide the documents and information required. This includes your residential address, proof of address, identity document, and a reason for creating an account. Under the reason for creating the account, you have to answer a number of questions. First is if the account is for you. More questions follow. They are about the source of funds, most recent occupation, primary purpose, employment status, and lastly, the expected monthly payments. In addition, you may provide proof of funds and proof of employment. However, these are optional. After completing the process, click on “Done”. You will receive a notification that the documents are under review which might take a while due to new policies.

Palremit support is available at [help@palremit.com](mailto:help@palremit.com). If you’re not the email type, you can opt for the live chat option right on the app. Click on “Settings” and navigate to the “Get Help” option.

## Security Features

Palremit, like any other fintech, offers security features.

#### Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)
Enhanced Due Diligence is an advanced verification. Palremit implements an EDD for large or unusual transactions. It requires a user to provide additional documents. 

#### Password and Transaction PIN
Password and transaction PIN features are both available on Palremit. The password allows sign-in access. On the other hand, the transaction PIN is used for authorizing a transfer.  

## Pros and Cons

#### Pros

- Crypto Service Offering
- Low USD Card Creation Fee
- Enhanced Due Diligence

Palremit offers crypto services, making it attractive to crypto enthusiasts. You can buy, sell, or swap cryptocurrencies of your choice. You can also make crypto deposits.

A $2 charge for USD cards is less than what you get on other fintech apps. You can be thankful for this.

The Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) makes Palremit a secure platform. This is definitely something positive. 

#### Cons

- Numerous Fees
- High Account Deletion Fee
- Lengthy KYC Process
- Unavailable on the Web:

Users are faced with numerous fees on Palremit. From the regular USD deposit fee to the not-so-regular card monthly maintenance fee, and the low-balance decline fee. 

Moreover, there's a high account deletion fee. Imagine paying $5 just to part with your USD account. 

Another possible downside is the KYC process. This is lengthy compared to on other fintech services. It might be a challenge for a typical user. 

Mobile apps make sense in terms of user-friendliness. However, some users appreciate the flexibility of accessing fintech dashboards on the web. Palremit does not support this form of usage.

## Alternatives Worth Considering

#### Chipper Cash

[Chipper Cash](https://monierate.com/converter/chippercash/?Amount=1&From=USD&To=NGN) is a top-contender among USD banking platforms. The solution offers advanced features and options to users across several countries. 

#### Cleva

If you’re looking for something specific to Nigeria, Cleva is a good start. Note that while they currently only serve Nigerians, they will be expanding soon.

#### Grey Finance
[Grey Finance](https://monierate.com/converter/grey/?Amount=1&From=USD&To=NGN) meets the requirement of a standard USD banking platform and more. 

## Final Thoughts

Palremit users must be careful about out-bound transactions. The same goes for recurring subscriptions linked to USD cards. Both of these can trigger a card decline low-balance charge-if there's insufficient fund.  

Secondly, Palremit currently supports BTC, ETH, USDT, and SOL cryptocurrencies. Regular users should find this sufficient. Thirdly, users cannot directly send USD from their account. 

The available option is converting from USD to a cryptocurrency or other currencies. The user can then send this to someone using their account. 

## Conclusion
Palremit works for basic USD banking operations and more. You might find their "awuf" data plans attractive.
