If you don't want to use Chipper Cash anymore, you can delete your account.

You don't need to give a reason.

But, consider the following before you proceed.

## Things to know about deleting your Chipper Cash account

* You need to give them your Chipper tag.
* Make sure you withdraw all your money first.
* Deleting your account is permanent. You can't get it back.
* You can't use the same information to create a new account.

If you're deleting your account for privacy reasons, you should know that Chipper Cash might still keep some of your information. This is because they need to keep a unique reference of your personal identity so you can't create a new account in the future.

I don't know exactly how or why they store this information, but it's something to be aware of before you delete your account.

## Steps to delete your Chipper Cash account

1. Open the Chipper Cash app.
2. Tap on the question mark icon in the top left corner of the screen.
3. Tap on "Chat with us".
4. Tap on "No, I want to chat with a person".
5. Tap on "Messages" and start a new message asking to delete your account.

If you are prompted with some automated message commands, follow these steps:

1. Select "Account Verification / Access / Update".
2. Select "Account Requests / Makes changes to my account".
3. Select "I want to delete my Chipper account".

Follow the prompts to complete the request.

**Remember, keep this in mind:**

* You will need to provide your Chipper Cash tag.
* Make sure you have withdrawn all of your money before you delete your account.
* Deleting your account is permanent. You cannot get it back.
