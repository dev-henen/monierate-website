Blockroll was recently listed on Monierate, which means as a professional, freelancer, creator and individual, you can now stay up to date with the Blockroll exchange rate on our platform.

Blockroll is a multi-currency payment and remittance solution built to empower Africans in the global economy, allowing you to receive international payments, hold and swap between local and foreign currencies (including stablecoins like USDC and USDT), issue invoices, manage payrolls, and even pay bills, all from a single app.

With the latest version launched in July 2025, just 2 months ago, Blockroll is already making headway in Africa, especially in Nigeria, with over 1,000 users, with plans to expand across the continent, including Kenya.

The [USDC to Naira](https://monierate.com/converter/blockroll/?Amount=1&From=usd&To=ngn) rate of Blockroll as of this writing is N1,561, which is relatively better than what you get out there without risking your USDC in the peer-to-peer market.
