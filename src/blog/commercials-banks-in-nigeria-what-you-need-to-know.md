#### **Deposit Taking:**

Commercial banks take deposits from customers. These deposits could be made to savings, fixed, or current accounts with various agreements.

Deposits are a big part of the financial system in place today. They directly impact reserve, make available funds for withdrawal, and drive brand influence.

#### **Discounting Bills of Exchange:**

Transactions in which a customer deposits a Bill of Exchange to a bank in order to get an advance of the bill. The bank may offer lesser interest and lower fees for this unexpired Bill of Exchange.

#### **Securities Trading:**

Commercial banks make it possible for customers to buy and sell securities. This feature is often offered by a bank in partnership with a trusted brokerage firm. 

More established banks may run securities trading services by themselves. Having such capability means customers get a full-packaged services.  

Although unrelated, we should mention that commercial banks also use their own capital to trade securities in a bid to make profit.

Assets and valuables can be stored in a bank controlled locker facility. This is  referred to as a safety deposit box service in Nigeria. 

Customers may store anything from copies of will to real estate deeds and even jewellry. All these is kept in a secure vault with advanced systems and 24/7 surveillance. 

High value customers and high networth individuals particularly make use of this service. The primary reason is due to the level of security involved.  

Charges for the safety deposit box service depends on several factors. They include the deposit box size, level of security, and the period of storage.

#### **Loans:**

Commercial banks offer loans and other forms of financial support to customers. 

The availability of loan services depend on the status of the borrower. This is measured in terms of their credit score. Customers with high credit scores get enticing loan terms involving lower fees, exteneded repayment periods, etc.

A variety of loan types exist for customers to choose from. Some are peculiar to the purchase of a specific good or property. Examples include car loans and mortgages.

On the other hand, many loans are not tied to any specific purchase. This gives users the freedom to utilise them as they wish. 

Interest on loans serve as a major source of income for banks.

#### **Overdraft:**

Overdraft refers to the withdrawal function on an account after it hits zero. This ensures that account owners can make payments, covering unexpected charges or emergency bills, even after they run out of funds.

Businesses benefit from overdraft as it is quickly accessible and costs less compared to loans. 

#### **Credit Gathering:**

Another function of commercial banks is credit gathering.  

Credit gathering may be defined as keeping track of credits or other payments owed to a bank. Also, it refers to the act of collecting such credits.

Credit gathering is facilitated by instruments such as cheques and promissary notes.

**Credit Creation:**

Credit creation, as a function of commercial banks, refers to a special way in which banking institutions make new money. When a customer is issued a loan or credit, the  bank makes a mandatory deposit into its reserve.

This reserve account is held by the Central Bank.

The reserve deposit could be less than the issued loan/credit amount, equivalent to it, or even higher. The amount depends on a factor known as the Credit Reserve Ratio (CRR) and on the following formula:

Total credit creation = Deposit amount x (1/r)

Central banks are responsible for determining the CRR which each commercial banks must adhere to. A fun fact here is that lower CRR values result in the creation of higher reserve deposits and vice versa. 

Making reserves ensures that there is always money in the economy. Moreover, reserve funds are used to service depositors who may want to withdraw.
