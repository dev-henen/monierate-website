## Researcher’s Take

Africa’s fintech story is one of leapfrogging and airtime APIs are a quiet force behind that leap.

In 2024, mobile money transactions on the continent hit an impressive $912 billion, driven by a 98% prepaid mobile market and more than 614 million users.

In this mobile-first ecosystem, airtime isn’t just about making calls; it’s fast becoming a form of currency.

Airtime APIs also let businesses plug airtime directly into their apps to power micropayments, reward loyal users, or keep customers engaged without needing full banking rails. 

This flexibility is especially valuable in regions where traditional infrastructure is limited, but mobile access is high.

Still, the path forward isn’t without bumps. Fraud remains a serious concern, with cases of unauthorised top-ups and backend exploits.

Regulations are also patchy across Africa, making it hard for innovators to build across borders with confidence.

What’s needed? Smarter security and clearer, more unified policies.

Those watching the market (Investors) should keep an eye on established players like DingConnect, known for scale and infrastructure, while Startups can go lean with platforms like Africa’s Talking, which lowers the barriers to entry with developer-friendly pricing and tools.

With a projected $65 billion market, airtime APIs aren’t just a technical feature; they’re a solid support of Africa’s digital economy. Understood well and used right, they could help millions access financial tools in ways that feel simple, seamless, and native to how people already live and connect.
