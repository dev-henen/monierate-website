Expanding into international markets unlocks new opportunities for exporters, but it also comes with financial challenges, especially when it comes to collecting foreign currency payments. Issues like currency fluctuations, slow settlements, and high conversion costs can erode profits and disrupt cash flow, making efficient payment solutions essential for sustained growth.

The good news? There’s [a smarter way to collect international payments](https://www.cedar.money/news-updates/5-best-practices-for-efficient-cross-border-payments). In this guide, we’ll break down the common challenges exporters face and how businesses can streamline their FX collections for faster, more cost-effective transactions

##  The Key Challenges Exporters Face in FX Collections from Africa

Many exporters encounter challenges when receiving payments from African buyers. Here are some of the most common obstacles:

### 1. Limited Banking Infrastructure

Many African businesses struggle with cross-border payments due to limited access to international banking networks.

Your Nigerian buyer initiates a bank transfer for a large order, but because their bank has limited access to international networks, the payment takes over a week to process. Worse still, additional transaction fees are deducted along the way. Now, you’re considering turning down the whole order because you can’t afford the delays and hidden costs cutting into your margins. The longer the payment takes to arrive, the more strain it puts on your cash flow, making it harder to fulfill future orders or reinvest in your business. If this happens repeatedly, you might start avoiding certain markets altogether—limiting your growth potential in Africa.

### 2. Currency Volatility & Conversion Costs

Currencies like the Nigerian Naira (NGN) and the Kenyan Shilling (KES) can experience high volatility. If you’re invoicing in local currencies, exchange rate fluctuations can impact the final amount you receive. Additionally, [multiple conversions](https://www.cedar.money/news-updates/how-importers-and-exporters-in-kenya-can-save-on-fx-costs) (e.g., NGN → USD → EUR) can increase FX costs.

### 3. Complex Compliance & Regulations

Regulatory frameworks across African countries vary significantly, with some governments enforcing strict FX controls. If a buyer has ever told you they couldn't remit payment due to local restrictions, you know how compliance challenges can disrupt your business. Without a trusted payment partner well-versed in these regulations, navigating them can become a complex and time-consuming task.

### 4. Slow Settlement Times

Traditional bank transfers from Africa to countries in other continents can take days or even weeks. Imagine you’ve lined up a new supplier for raw materials, but you can’t place an order until your last payment from Kenya clears. Traditional bank transfers can take days—or even weeks—leaving your business in limbo. These slow settlements slow down your [cash flow](https://www.cedar.money/news-updates/5-ways-to-improve-your-business-cash-flow-in-2025), make financial planning difficult and can put unnecessary strain on your operations.
