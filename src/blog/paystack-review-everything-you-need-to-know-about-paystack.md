Digital payments have surged over the last five years, with transaction volumes increasing by an impressive 37%, according to the 2024 State of Inclusive Instant Payment Systems in Africa (SIIPS) Report released last Friday.

## Understanding Paystack

[Paystack](https://paystack.com/) makes it easy for businesses in Africa to accept payments from anyone, anywhere in the world. Founded in 2015 by Ezra Olubi and Shola Akinlade, it was created to solve the payment challenges many African businesses faced. Today, Paystack helps businesses grow with simple, reliable payment solutions that work both online and offline.

#### Who does Paystack cater to?

Paystack primarily serves startups, payroll companies, small businesses, and medium-sized enterprises, whether registered or not. It’s designed to meet the needs of entrepreneurs, established companies, and even individual sellers, making it an ideal choice for businesses at all stages of growth.

## Core Services and Features

Paystack provides these essential services:

- **Payment Gateway:** This is the foundation of Paystack. It allows businesses to securely accept online payments via various methods, including cards, bank transfers, and mobile money.   
- **Payment Processing:** Paystack handles the entire payment process, from securely collecting customer payment information to transferring funds to your business account.   
- **Offline Payments:** Paystack provides flexible solutions for in-person transactions as well. They offer physical POS terminals for businesses that prefer traditional card readers, and their innovative Virtual Terminal allows you to accept payments through QR codes generated on your phone or computer. 

**Key Features**

What makes Paystack stand out are the features that enhance these core services:

- **Diverse Payment Channels:** From card payments to mobile money to USSD, Paystack supports a wide array of options that cater to how people prefer to pay in Africa. This ensures businesses can reach more customers and reduce abandoned carts.  
- **Effortless Integration:** Developers can connect Paystack to their website and even offline systems with ease. They have plugins for popular platforms like WooCommerce and Shopify and a well-documented API.

## How Paystack works

The good news is: pretty much anyone can set up a Paystack account.

But, here’s the deal. Only businesses that submit an activation request and are subsequently approved will be able to receive online payments.

If you’re not activated yet? You’ll be limited to running test payments—helpful for practice, but not much else.

So, how does Paystack work for businesses? Well, it’s versatile enough to suit just about any setup. The right option depends on how your business operates, the kind of payments you want to accept, your technical skills, and the features you need. Paystack offers user-friendly tools like Payment Pages and Paystack Invoices.

- **Paystack Invoices** lets you create professional invoices and send them to customers. Once they get it, they can pay you directly—no need for them to sign up for anything.
- **Payment Pages** work similarly but are even simpler. You create a custom URL, send it to your customers, and they can pay through the page. Perfect for freelancers and small businesses that don’t have a website yet.

But if you already have a website, you can use Paystack plugins for platforms like WordPress, Shopify, or Magento. These make it easy to start accepting payments without building a payment system from scratch.

For custom setups, developers can use Paystack Studio, which includes APIs and SDKs, to integrate and fully customize how Paystack works for their business.

##### Accepting Payments

Your customers can pay with any of the payment options that Paystack supports:

- Cards: Visa, Mastercard, and American Express
- Bank Transfers: Direct bank transfers from various Nigerian banks
- Mobile Money: MTN MoMo, PocketApp, Vodafone Cash, AirtelTigo Money, and M-PESA (depending on the country)
- USSD
- Scan-to-pay using Visa QR codes

##### Receiving Funds

Paystack allows you to accept payments from anywhere in the world, but you'll need to request this feature and provide business registration details. Funds are settled in Naira based on your bank's exchange rate.

You can also choose to manually withdraw funds to your bank account or opt for automatic 

next-day payouts on weekdays.

##### Getting Started

It's as easy as 1, 2, 3!

- Head over to the Paystack website and sign up for free.
- Provide the necessary information to activate your account and start accepting live payments.
- Select the option that best fits your business (payment pages, invoices, plugins, or API).

And that's it on using Paystack in a nutshell. It simple to use, has tons of options, and is built for businesses of all shapes and sizes.

## Paystack Fees

Setting up a Paystack account is free. You only pay when you start receiving payments. The fees depend on your customer’s location.

For local transactions, Paystack charges 1.5% of the transaction amount plus ₦100. Transactions under ₦2,500 are exempt from the flat fee, and fees are capped at ₦2,000, even for large amounts.

International transactions cost 3.9% plus ₦100, with the same ₦2,500 exemption for the flat fee. However, Paystack caps the fee at ₦2,000.

The pricing model has one major advantage: you can offset fees by adjusting your product prices. But, Paystack doesn’t support automatic fee offsetting, so you'll need to manually add the applicable fees to each product price. While a bit of a hassle, it’s worth considering to save on costs.

## Security

To answer the burning question of if Paystack is secure, the answer is a solid yes.

As a PCI Service Provider Level 3 payment gateway, it follows the highest standards for protecting your transactions. All data is encrypted over HTTPS, and your card details are protected with AES-256 GCM encryption. Even Paystack can’t access your card info because decryption keys are kept on separate servers.

And to go the extra mile, Paystack uses AI to scan transactions for fraud, blocking risky ones automatically. Plus, [businesses](https://support.paystack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009972619-What-types-of-businesses-are-eligible-to-use-Paystack#:~:text=Almost%20all%20types%20of%20businesses,NGOs%2C%20and%20many%20many%20others.) in sensitive industries get additional verification. Regular scheduled maintenance ensures everything stays secure, and Paystack Vault lets you store card info securely for faster payments with OTP protection.

## Paystack support 

Paystack seems to have a pretty decent support system in place. They've got a ton of helpful information on their website, including detailed [documentation](https://paystack.com/docs/) and [user manual](https://support.paystack.com/). Plus, they're pretty active on social media, so you can usually get a quick response there, even for minor issues.

But if you need more personalized help, you can always reach out to their support team directly through email (support\@paystack.com) or their contact form.

#### What users are saying

We've been keeping an ear to the ground, and it seems like most folks have good things to say about Paystack. Developers seem to love how easy their API is to use, and everyday users are raving about the smooth checkout experience. But of course, no platform is perfect. Here's a taste of what people are saying, the good and the not-so-good:

_"Paystack's API is a breeze. Their documentation is so easy to follow, it feels like I'm just copying and pasting into Typescript."_ - Dev\_umar

_"Paystack actually did a madness with Pay-with-PocketApp. Just tried it and wow! It's so seamless."_ - Stephanie

_"Nobody is going to make checkout like Paystack mhen."_ - ayomide.eth

_"Transactions have been failing on Paystack lately, I've had 2 failures within 2 weeks."_ - Elizabeth Gaskell

The customer support is a mixed bag for most. But firsthand we've found that Paystack's response time depends on when you contact them. If you reach out early in the morning, you'll usually hear back the same day. 

But if you message them later in the day, it might take until the next day to get a response. We reached out to them on a Sunday via X and got a reply in about 20 hours. On a weekday, it was faster. So, it seems like they generally aim to respond within 24 hours, but your mileage may vary.

## So, is Paystack the right fit for your business?

If you're running a business in Africa and you want a payment system that's reliable and easy to use, then Paystack is definitely worth checking out. 

One of the best things about Paystack is that it's made for Africa. They understand how people like to pay here, so they offer all the popular options like mobile money and bank transfers, alongside the usual card payments.

But keep in mind that no system is perfect. Some users have reported problems with failed transactions, and higher fees and it seems like their customer support can be a bit inconsistent.

At the end of the day, the best way to know if Paystack is right for you is to give it a shot and see if it clicks with your business.
