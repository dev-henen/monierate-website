How can you convert your Naira for BTC on the Bybit Android app?



Bybit’s P2P platform has a significant user base and a reputation for reliability. And with their escrow system in place, your crypto trades are most secure.



The platform also supports a variety of fiat currencies such as NGN and in a few straightforward steps, at mutually agreed-upon prices, you can acquire BTC right in your wallet without intermediary fees.



We’ll show you how in this guide!



## Before converting BTC on Bybit with NGN on Bybit



Here are the two things you need to do or keep in mind:



1.  You must have created a Bybit account and completed the KYC verification.

If you choose the bank transfer method, you will get a list of merchants that accept only Bank transfers, so select one based on what you need.
