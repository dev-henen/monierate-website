## Grey’s Journey Since 2020

Idorenyin Obong and Femi Aghedo founded Grey.co in 2020 to simplify international payments for remote workers and digital nomads in Africa. Initially launched as **Aboki Africa**, the platform set out to tackle the challenges of traditional banking systems, such as high exchange rates and hidden [fees](https://monierate.com/blog/what-is-fees-and-what-you-need-to-know-about-it). By 2021, users could open virtual accounts to receive payments locally, but some limitations—like the absence of ACH support—remained.

In August 2021, [Grey](https://monierate.com/ng/compare/providers/grey-exchange-rates) began working on a rebrand to reflect its growing ambitions. The [transition to Grey](https://grey.co/blog/aboki-africa-becomes-grey) was officially announced in November 2022, marking a significant shift. It wasn’t just a name change; Grey updated its logo, revamped its website, and rebranded its social media handles to **Grey Finance** on Instagram and Twitter. The company shared that the new identity was designed to convey stability and neutrality while also emphasizing the platform's mission of enabling Africans to access international payments seamlessly.

The rebrand coincided with major developments, such as introducing foreign accounts, ACH services, and an expanded product line. This period also saw Grey raise $2 million in funding, which facilitated its expansion into Kenya and East Africa and allowed partnerships with companies like Cellulant and Moringa.

Grey’s diversification didn’t stop there. In early 2024, the company launched its GiftCards service, which continues to grow, offering users more options for sending and receiving value across borders.

Today, Grey boasts a 4.7-star app rating and a team of over 50 employees in six countries.

## Possible business model for Grey.co

It appears they use a multifaceted business model that combines transaction-based fees, a marketplace for third-party providers, and commission-based earnings. Here's how these components might work:

#### 1. Transaction-based Model

This seems to be Grey.co’s primary revenue driver, with fees collected for various services:

- **International Money Transfers** 

Grey undoubtedly charges a fee for each cross-border payment. This could be a flat fee or a percentage of the total amount sent. For example, they might charge a flat fee of $3 per transfer or a 1% fee on the total transaction value.

- **Deposits** 

Small fees for deposits can also create a steady stream of revenue when it adds up over time and depending on the frequency. 

- **Card Creation**

Grey charges a $4 one-time fee for creating a virtual card. If a card is cancelled due to insufficient funds, users might have to pay again for a replacement, potentially generating recurring revenue.

#### 2. Commission-based Model

Grey also acts as a marketplace, connecting users with other companies for things like gift cards, airtime, and bill payments.

- **Gift Cards**

Grey partners with gift card providers, allowing users to buy gift cards from popular brands right on their platform. These providers obviously would pay Grey a fee for access to their user base.

- **Airtime and Bill Payments** 

Grey makes it easy for users to top up their airtime or pay bills through their platform. They probably earn a commission from the service providers for each transaction.

### Why it works:

- **Accessibility:** Grey focuses on providing financial services to underserved communities, particularly in Africa, fostering customer loyalty and tapping into a growing market.   
- **Diversification:** Grey's revenue model is diversified, with income generated from transaction fees, commissions, and potentially monthly fees for foreign currency accounts. This diversification helps mitigate risk and ensures multiple revenue streams.   
- **Scalability:** The platform is designed to be scalable, allowing them to expand their services and user base efficiently. This scalability can lead to increased revenue and market share.   

## In conclusion

Grey.co is doing some pretty cool things in the fintech world, and they're set up for some serious growth. 

They really get what their customers need, and they keep making their platform better and better. 

So, even though we don't know exactly how much they make on each transaction, it's obvious that their different ways of bringing in money are working for them. 

Definitely keep an eye on Grey.co!
