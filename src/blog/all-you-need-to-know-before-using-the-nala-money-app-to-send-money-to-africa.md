![All You Need to Know Before Using The Nala App](https://ik.imagekit.io/monierate/Blog/product/all_you_need_to_know_before_using_the_nala_app.webp)

Sending money to loved ones in Africa remains expensive, even with increased competition with remittances. The average cost of sending $200 to Sub-Saharan Africa is about 7.9%—higher than the global 6.65 average. And while that's down from 12% in 2011, it's still a reach from the UN's 3% target. Yet, over $80 billion flows yearly from overseas to families and friends in the region. This shows the strength of bonds, and Nala understands this.

Available in 21 countries, Nala is a money transfer app built for those connections. Users in the UK, US, and EU can easily send funds to loved ones in Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, and more.

## Nala Money Review: Payment methods

Currently, NALA supports personal debit card payments for transactions. Credit cards aren’t an option due to higher processing costs, which would mean passing those fees on to users—a move the platform avoids to keep things affordable.

For transfers, NALA integrates various methods, including digital wallets, bank accounts, debit cards, and even Google and Apple Pay. Recipients can also receive funds directly into their bank accounts or NALA’s digital wallet, offering flexibility for users.

## Nala Money Review: Mobile app

NALA operates exclusively through its mobile app, which has received impressive ratings—4.8/5 on Google Play and 4.7/5 on the App Store—with around 2,000 reviews across platforms. The app allows users to manage their digital wallets, send money internationally, track transfers, and pay bills, all in one place.

While the app is available for download in Africa, it’s not functional for residents there, as the service primarily caters to users in the UK, US, and EU. This limitation highlights Nala’s focus on diaspora communities rather than local users.

## Nala Money Review: Fees

NALA doesn’t charge upfront fees for transfers, but if you’re sending money to a bank account, a fee of $0.99 may apply. However, the real cost lies in the exchange rates. NALA applies an average markup of 1.52% to the mid-market exchange rate, which is essentially a hidden fee embedded within the conversion rate.

The exact markup varies depending on the currency pair, but NALA’s partnerships with Sendwave and Remitly enable competitive options with multiple rates for the same currencies. When using Apple Pay for transfers, you won’t encounter extra processing fees, but the exchange rate markup still applies, ensuring some cost for every transfer.

Based on general insights, NALA's transfer limits typically depend on the country you're sending from, the destination country, and the payment method. For most users, daily and monthly transfer caps are in place to comply with regulatory standards, often ranging between a few hundred to several thousand dollars, euros, or pounds. Specific limits may also vary for first-time users or based on verification levels. Always check the app for the exact limits relevant to your transaction.

### NALA Wallet

Whether you're planning regular remittances or hoping to save time on recurring payments, the built-in NALA Wallet is a practical tool. Here's what it provides:

#### Main Wallet

The Main Wallet lets you transfer funds from your bank account into your NALA account at your convenience. Available for £GBP and €EUR users, it supports transfers to various recipient countries, including Tanzania, Kenya, Nigeria, and more. It also lets you top up monthly, enabling controlled, incremental transfers directly from your wallet.

#### Rewards Wallet

The Rewards Wallet ties into NALA's Refer a Friend program. When you refer someone, and they complete a transaction, both of you receive a reward deposited into your Rewards Wallet. Available in €EUR, £GBP, and $USD, rewards can only be used for transactions to a recipient of your choice, adding extra value for loyal users.

### Payment Reminders

NALA lets you easily set up and manage payment reminders through the app. You can create reminders from the settings menu or by scheduling a repeat for any past transaction. Scheduling options include start date, time, and recurrence (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly).

You get to also edit or delete reminders as long as the scheduled time is at least an hour away. When a reminder is due, a push notification guides you to complete the payment in just a few taps—confirm the amount and authorize your transaction.
