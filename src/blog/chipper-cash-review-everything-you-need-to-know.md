3.  Your Bank Verification Number (BVN).
 After signing up, you'll receive a six-digit verification code to confirm your account. Next, you can create a username and set a default currency for transactions. Chipper Cash allows you to link multiple phone numbers or email addresses for flexible access.

## Fees and Limits on Chipper Cash

Chipper Cash is designed to be as cost-effective as possible. You won't pay a dime to send money—whether it's within your country or across borders. This platform uses live exchange rates, ensuring you get an accurate deal without any hidden fees.

**Funding Your Chipper Cash Account**
Adding funds to your Chipper Cash account is straightforward. Simply copy your Chipper Cash account number, then use your bank app to transfer the desired amount. The funds will be credited to your Chipper Cash account immediately, allowing you to send money, make payments, or trade stocks without delay.

**Limits on Sending and Withdrawing Funds**
As a new user, you're free to receive unlimited funds. However, there are sending and withdrawal limits. Initially, you can send up to ₦4,000,000 daily or ₦20,000,000 weekly and withdraw a maximum of ₦20,000 per day. To increase these limits, you'll need to verify your identity with your BVN and a selfie. Once verified, your limits bump up to ₦5,000,000 daily, ₦35,000,000 weekly, and ₦1,000,000 for daily withdrawals.

If you opt for the Chipper USD Card, there are a few costs to keep in mind. It costs $5 to create the card, and there's a $1 monthly maintenance fee.

**Stock Trading Fees**
For those interested in stock trading, a one-time access fee of $10 is required to set up your account. After that, a $1 monthly maintenance fee applies. Trading fees depend on the transaction size—0.15% for amounts under $10,000, and a flat $15 fee for larger trades.

**Currency Exchange and Wallet Funding**
