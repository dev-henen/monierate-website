Interesting times are ahead for crypto in general. From price fluctuations to easing regulations and new use cases, a lot is happening. In this article, we portray the timeline of crypto regulation in Nigeria.

This should allow you make your forecasts, and hopefully understand what the existing condition is.

## What are Crypto Regulations?

Crypto regulations are simply crypto-related rules and guidelines. They are laws set to direct the complex crypto ecosystem. Investors, crypto service providers, and governments are all at the receiving end of this.

Typically, crypto regulations can be broad or narrow.

They are broad in cases where the entire ecosystem is being addressed. Otherwise, they are narrow. These narrow regulations seek to resolve specific issues. An example might be licensing.

## The State of Crypto Regulations Worldwide

Certain regions have advanced crypto regulations. Western countries like the US top this list. Others such as Germany and South Africa are making significant progress.

In the same context, a few regions are completely lost. These are jurisdictions which do not recognize cryptocurrencies. By implication, they don’t have any regulations on the subject.

The realization here is that global crypto regulation is uncoordinated. Some countries/policies are far behind. Some are leading the way. The rest are stalling.

Industry leaders and enthusiasts are not happy with this. They are calling for uniformity. They want things to change.

Thankfully, their cries have not been in vain.

In the last few years, more and more regions have found a common ground. An example is with AML-CFT measures. Countries like Switzerland, Singapore, and Japan are all in on it.

They agree that Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing are concerns. As a result, they’ve fostered adherence to the FATF’s Travel Rule. A larger number of countries also employ robust KYC processes.

Among other things, crypto regulations help to create transparency. Information on the performance of a cryptocurrency and the community behind it can be kept public. In turn, investors will know what they are engaging with.

It is clear how this creates a cycle that is beneficial and rewarding.

## Nigeria’s Crypto Regulation Timeline

There was no major crypto regulatory activities in Nigeria until 2021. However, once the regulations began, it came down heavy. Here’s a timeline of crypto regulations in Nigeria.

More events went down in the month of the ban. On February 22, SEC Nigeria demanded regulation for cryptocurrencies. The Vice President at the time also supported the view. He insisted on the development of a regulatory framework rather than a ban.
  

**March 2021**

On March 21, the CBN made an announcement regarding its crypto ban. The statement claimed to clarify the decision. It stated that individuals could still trade or own crypto but not through local banks or fintech.

  

**April 2021**

The SEC made a positive announcement on April 15. It mentioned that there were ongoing discussions with the CBN. This discussion was to find a common ground on regulation.

The decision was welcomed with open hands by enthusiasts across the country. It had been over 2.5 years since the ban was initiated. With the new regulation, investors were hopeful for the future.

## Conclusion

The downside to ignoring innovation is getting lost for coming on the scene late. Nigeria, like many other African countries, now painfully realizes this.

The Nigerian government was forced to give up its stringent regulatory stand. In a statement from the CBN governor, regulators worldwide are having a shift of attitude. And why wouldn’t they? The crypto industry is already worth over USD1 trillion.

Despite bans and bottleneck regulations, the entire system is growing. In Nigeria, locals reportedly*hyperlink Kucoin* traded USD56.7 billion between July 22 and June 2023. That happened while the ban was still in effect.

The conclusion here is the need for regulators to read potential. Also, they must understand possibilities and correctly weigh what works and what doesn’t. All in all, there’s no straight path to regulation but those overseeing it must do their very best.
