## What has changed since 2018?

## What is the company’s business model?

Chipper Cash's business model focuses on generating revenue from a few key sources while keeping its core service (free money transfers) intact to attract users. 

The platform primarily makes money through fees on stock and cryptocurrency transactions, interchange fees from its debit card, and fees businesses pay to use its Network API.

With customers onboard, the company introduces additional products, like its virtual debit card and investment options, which provide revenue through transaction fees and interchange fees. Every time a user makes a card payment, Chipper Cash earns a small portion of the transaction fee, which is shared with partners like Visa.

The investment side of Chipper Cash allows users to trade stocks or cryptocurrencies, with each transaction incurring a 1% fee. This is a significant revenue stream, as users are drawn to the convenience of purchasing stocks from major companies and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, all within the app.

Businesses that use Chipper's API to process payments also contribute to the company’s revenue, paying a fee for the ability to collect recurring payments, issue refunds, and make payments across borders. Chipper Cash also protects businesses by verifying the identity of all users, reducing the risk of fraud—a significant issue across the continent.

3.  **Manage Subscriptions**  
    If you use Chipper Cash for subscriptions, regularly audit them and cancel services you no longer need. This prevents unexpected charges that could result in declined payments.
    
4.  **Overfund Your Virtual Card**  
    If you use Chipper Cash’s virtual card for online transactions, consider overfunding it. This helps ensure your card is always ready for use and reduces the risk of declined transactions.
    
5.  **Set Reminders**  
    Enable in-app notifications for low balances or declined transactions. Additionally, set reminders for your last funding date to ensure your account is topped up in time.
    
6.  **Understand the Fee Structure**  
    Familiarize yourself with the fees related to declined transactions. Knowing these details will help you plan better and avoid unnecessary costs.
