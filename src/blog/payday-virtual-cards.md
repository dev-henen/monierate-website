## What you need to know about the Payday Virtual Cards

#### Internet only
Payday Virtual Cards can only be used online. The Mastercard can only be used anywhere USD cards are accepted. The Visa card can only be used anywhere USD cards are accepted. And the Verve card can only be used anywhere naira Verve cards are accepted.

#### Restricted platforms
Payday Virtual Cards may not work on platforms that fall under the following category:

-   Casino & Gambling
-   Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency
-   Money Transfer

Also, not all platforms accept virtual or prepaid cards. The Payday cards are virtual and also prepaid in design, so they won’t be accepted on platforms that do not accept virtual or prepaid cards.

#### Card disclosure
Payday advises customers to keep their cards funded to avoid fees for declined transactions. Multiple unsuccessful attempts to debit your card may lead to permanent deactivation.

#### Downtime
Payday relies on a service provider to issue virtual cards to customers. There is no guarantee that the card service will always be up. In fact, on social media and also on Payday's social handle, there is no lack of notification of virtual card downtime every week.

In April 2023, Payday suspended its virtual card service due to an update from its service provider. So expect downtime when using the Payday virtual cards.

### 24-hours delay
Payday virtual cards are typically created within 24 hours.
