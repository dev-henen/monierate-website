As the world continues to recover from the impact of COVID-19 and navigates ongoing geopolitical crises, people everywhere are rethinking how to advocate for social, political, environmental, and economic rights. Social movements are stepping up, exploring innovative ways to create change and empower communities.

Across Africa, Bitcoiners are leading this charge, driving social change with support from grants by the [Human Rights Foundation (HRF)](https://hrf.org/hrf-bitcoin-development-fund-grants-1-billion-satoshis-to-20-projects-worldwide). The HRF, a nonpartisan nonprofit, promotes and protects human rights globally, with a focus on regions under authoritarian regimes.

This piece will highlight the 20 global projects supported by HRF grants on September 17, each working to enhance technical education, decentralize mining, and offer private financial solutions for people living under oppressive governments.

## The bigger picture for Africa

So, what does all this mean for Africa? It's simple: these Bitcoin projects are more than just cool tech; they're reshaping how people interact with money on the continent. With backing from organizations like HRF, people are finding ways to use their money and build a better future, as well as standing up for human rights.

Think about it: Bitcoin lets you bypass those old banking systems which also means inflation and corruption are fortunately a minus. Plus, the digital coin gives you more privacy and control—who wouldn't want that?

Sure, there are still challenges. Governments might try to get in the way, and not everyone understands Bitcoin yet. But the possibilities are huge. Imagine a world where everyone has access to financial tools, where entrepreneurs can thrive, and where activists can operate without fear. That's the kind of future Bitcoin can help build in Africa.

We think this is just the beginning. As more people join the movement, the impact will only grow stronger. And that's something worth getting excited about.
