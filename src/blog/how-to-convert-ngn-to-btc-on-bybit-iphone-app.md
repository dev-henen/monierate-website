To Swap your Naira for BTC on Bybit exchange app, you simply buy from a seller accepting NGN. Bybit P2P links you to sellers, free of charge, with an escrow system for secure trades. The seller’s crypto is held until they confirm your payment, then it’s released to you.

And how’s that done on the Bybit iOS app?

Follow along!

## How to get started on the Bybit app

Here are two things to do if you’re set to exchange NGN to BTC on Bybit:



1. First you need to sign up for a Bybit account and go through the KYC verification.



2. When making the payment from your Nigerian bank account, avoid using any crypto-related terms in the transaction description or narration.



With these steps done, you’re all set to buy BTC smoothly.



## How to convert BTC with NGN using the Bybit iPhone App

Step 1: Launch the Bybit app and head to ‘P2P Trading’ under ‘More’ from the Buy Crypto service options

Step 2: Hit ‘Acknowledge’ from the payment instructions on the popup and from the ‘Buy’ tab, ensure that BTC is highlighted, then proceed to set your BTC buy amount in Naira (e.g., ₦15,000, ₦20,000) and click ‘Confirm.’

Bybit then automatically filters out merchants that want to sell with a trading limit option of the amount range you have selected. You can refine your options by selecting your preferred payment method (e.g., bank transfer).



If you choose the bank transfer method, you will get a list of merchants that accept only Bank transfers, so select one based on what you need.

N.B.: A merchant with an “ineligible” tag indicates they’re either out of BTCUSDT or offline.



Step 3: Next, pick a merchant you’d like to trade with based on their completed orders, accuracy, and online status.
