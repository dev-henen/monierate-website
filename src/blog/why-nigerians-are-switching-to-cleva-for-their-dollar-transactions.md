According to the World Bank's [**"Working Without Borders: The Promise and Peril of Online Gig Work"**](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/ebc4a7e2-85c6-467b-8713-e2d77e954c6c) ****report (2023), freelance job postings on major digital platforms have surged globally, with Sub-Saharan Africa experiencing an impressive 130% growth — far outpacing North America’s 14% growth. This rapid expansion highlights the region’s increasing embrace of digital platforms for work opportunities.

Nigeria stands at the forefront of this freelance revolution. With an estimated 500,000 freelancers contributing to the country’s thriving gig economy, the nation is positioning itself as a hub for digital and remote work.

However, managing payments, especially cross-border payments in dollar to naira conversions – remains a major challenge for most Nigerian freelancers. A recent analysis shows that the majority of Nigerian freelancers and remote workers face considerable difficulties with international payments, often losing a significant portion of their earnings, up to 8.5% — to high transfer fees and unfavourable exchange rates. This challenge underscores the pressing need for more efficient, cost-effective cross-border payment solutions tailored to their needs.

Whether you’re a freelancer, remote worker, online entrepreneur, or simply someone receiving payments in foreign currency, you’ve probably asked yourself: _Isn’t there a better way?_

The answer is yes – and that’s why Nigerians are making the switch to [**Cleva**](https://www.getcleva.com/), a game-changing cross-border banking platform designed to meet your needs. But what exactly makes Cleva the top choice for dollar transactions? Let’s break it down.

### **1. Transparent Exchange Rates That Work in Your Favour**

Handling dollar transactions often comes with the frustration of unclear exchange rates, hidden charges, and unfavourable conversions that eat into your earnings. Many ask: _"How do I get the best exchange rate for my dollar transactions without breaking the bank, whether it’s one dollar to naira or larger amounts?"_

[Cleva ](http://www.getcleva.com)changes the game with:

- Real-time exchange rates you can trust.
- No hidden fees or sneaky deductions.

Whether you’re a freelancer earning dollars or an online entrepreneur tracking the dollar to naira rate, Cleva ensures transparency at every step.


### **2. Affordable Fees That Save You More**

It’s no secret that high fees are a dealbreaker for many Nigerians handling dollar transactions. Why pay exorbitant charges just to access your own money? With Cleva:

- You only pay $1 to receive ACH deposits of up to $100.
- Unlike some platforms that pile on hidden costs, Cleva’s charges are transparent and predictable.

This affordability ensures you keep more of your money, making it perfect for freelancers looking to maximize their income when converting 5000 USD to naira or smaller amounts.
