Breet App was recently listed on [monierate.com](http://monierate.com), which means you can now track, get alerts, and stay up to date with Breet exchange rates.

Launched in 2021, [Breet](https://breet.io) is an automated over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency exchange designed to simplify the complexities of crypto trading and spending. With a mission to make crypto spendable.

At the time of this writing, 23 July 2025,

The [USDT to Naira rate of Breet](https://monierate.com/converter/breet/?Amount=1&From=usd&To=ngn) as of this writing is N1510, which is relatively better than what you get out there without risking your USDT in the peer-to-peer market.

I shouldn’t tell you the app is easy enough, because over 250,000 active users and 3 million crypto trades have been executed.

Both Nigerians and Ghanians love the app.
