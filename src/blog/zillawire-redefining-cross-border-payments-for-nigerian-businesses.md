At Zilla, we understand the challenges businesses face when navigating the delicate world of cross-border transactions. The rates are ever-changing and a service that was available yesterday has put several restrictions in place today. We know this because we’ve been there.

That's why we started Zillawire, a B2B cross-border FX payments platform. Designed to make international transactions a breeze, Zillawire is more than just a service; it's a partner in your business’ success. Now, when you need to pay your foreign suppliers, all you will need to do is log in to your [Zillawire account](https://app.zillawire.com/login).

We’ve said we’re different; better. But how? Let's dive into the details:

### Swift, Efficient, and Inclusive
Approved payments typically take 24-48 working hours to process, ensuring that your transactions are not only secure but also efficient. You can make payments to business partners in over 100 countries and send up to the equivalent of $10m in almost 10 different currencies (GBP, USD, CAD, Dubai AED, RMB, CNY, Euro, etc.)

And contrary to common misconception, Zillawire is open to all businesses, regardless of size, as long as you meet the necessary credential requirements.

## Exclusive for Business Transactions
We want to make it clear – Zillawire is exclusively designed for business transactions. Whether it's paying international suppliers, managing business remittances, or optimizing your global financial strategy, we've got you covered.

We are devoted to your businesses and ensuring that they succeed.

## Empowering Your Business
One of our standout features is the ability for business owners to access credit. This isn't cash in hand – it's a tool to settle invoices and pay your suppliers. Think of it as a financial boost, available after three successful transactions. To apply, a simple email to _support\@zilla.africa_ is all it takes.

## Favourable Rates
Zillawire [rates](https://monierate.com/converter/zillawire?Amount=1&From=USD&To=NGN) are one of the most competitive in the market and we have a transparent fee structure. We charge a flat rate of N1 per transaction which you will be able to see before going through with your payments.

## Stability and Support
We are a Canadian-licensed company and the FX partner for over 200 businesses. In the last quarter of 2023 alone, we processed over $10m in payments. You can rely on our global network and our track record of stability, even during market volatility. 

You can feel confident with our ASX listing and robust security ensuring the safety of your funds.

Zillawire is not just a platform; it's a commitment to empowering your business on the global stage. Join us to experience the ease of international transactions, and let's unlock the full potential of your business together!
