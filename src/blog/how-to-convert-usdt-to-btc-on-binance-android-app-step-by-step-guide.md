### Things to consider before converting crypto on the Binance App

- Before you convert e.g. (USDT to BTC), you must have created a Binance account and done the necessary KYC verification processes.

- You must have already funded your account with some USDT via your Binance Spot or Funding Wallet.

- The Binance app comes with two interface displays: Binance Lite and Binance Pro. Binance Lite is the default interface. This article covers the steps for both versions.

#### Step 3: Select an Order

Click on either a ‘Market’ or ‘Limit’ order to convert your assets. A ‘Market’ order converts at the current market price instantly, while a ‘Limit’ order lets you set a specific price for the conversion. However, reaching your set limit price does not guarantee your order will be executed.

#### Keep these in mind while using the Binance mobile app:

- **Fees**: Binance charges a small trading fee for both “Convert” and spot trading. Be sure to factor these fees into your calculations.

- **Minimum amounts**: There might be minimum and maximum limits for converting or trading cryptocurrencies on Binance. Check the platform’s guidelines before proceeding.

- **Security**: Always practice good security hygiene when dealing with cryptocurrencies. Use strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and be cautious of phishing scams.
