Bybit is one of the top platforms where you can easily sell your Bitcoin and recieve naira in your bank account.



The app design is similar to the Binance App. The app design may be a little complex if you are not a tech person or a seasoned Bitcoin user. But once you are familiar with it, you will find it easier and faster to sell on Bybit than on other platforms.

The last time I used this app was in 2017, although I still have friends and family who use the app on a frequent basis to date.



Remitano is a peer-to-peer marketplace that allows you to trade your Bitcoin for Naira directly with buyers, with a 1% trading fee. What this means is that you post that you want to sell your Bitcoin and someone who wants to buy will jump on it and send you naira to your bank account.

Quidax is a user-friendly app popular in Nigeria that allows you to sell your Bitcoin and recieve naira in your bank account. Your Bitcoin is safe according to them, so less worries.



One thing I didn't mention earlier is that some of these apps charge a fee when you want to perform a transaction. But Quidax has low fees (in naira) and no hidden charges.



The intuitive interface, instant withdrawal feature, and the app's availability on Android make it a convenient choice for beginners.
