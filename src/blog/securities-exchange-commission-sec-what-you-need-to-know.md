What Is the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC)?

The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) is generally a monitoring and regulatory body. To be specific, the institution fosters control, standardization, and development in a capital market. 

Most countries around the globe have “SEC”, including Nigeria. For a few others, however, the same agency is known by another name. 

Security and Exchange Commissions are an important regulatory faculty. They work individually to set and create the best capital markets in their local countries, Also, they may work as an international group, setting a global scope.  

## History of SEC Nigeria

**Creation of the Capital Issues Committee**  

SEC Nigeria is the industry name of the local Securities Exchange Commission. The agency’s becoming began in 1962. In that year, the Capital Issues Committee was unofficially created.

The Committee operated under the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Its purpose was to sort out the ongoing struggles in the capital market. Precisely, this involved prompt clearance of applications coming from companies. 

CBN received humongous amounts of applications to raise capital from the capital market. However, with the Capital Issues Committee present, this problem was well addressed.

**Creation of the Capital Issues Commission**

Time went on and the country’s economic activities grew. Growth of such nature always creates a wind of change. In this case, it was the need for a legal and legitimate institution to handle the applications. The outcome was the establishment of the Capital Issues Commission in March 1973. 

A total of nine members made up the new commission. A chairman was chosen from the apex bank, CBN. Eight other people from different national sectors joined him. 

This team carried on their duties for over six years. In 1979, a Financial System Review Committee recognized the increased activities of the capital market. It, therefore, moved to enhance the capability of the existing Capital Issues Commission.

And guess what the review committee proposed?

**Transforming into SEC Nigeria**

Exactly as you would think. First was the creation of the Securities Exchange Commission through Decree 71. Second, the commission could determine the prices of issues and plan securities allotment. 

An outstanding difference between the SEC and previously established commissions existed. That was the disjointment of the latest commission from the central bank. In essence, SEC Nigeria was allowed to operate as an independent body.   

The new agency took off operations on January 1, 1980. It had 51 staff and sported a 12-man board to oversee things. Like before, the board chairman came from the CBN. Other members came from institutions such as the Nigeria Stock Exchange, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Trade and Industries. 

**Joining the IOSCO**

In June 1985, SEC Nigeria became a part of the IOSCO. This stands for the International Organization of Securities Commissions. It is a body of Security Exchange Commissions worldwide. 

The IOSCO have a goal of standardizing and cooperating on the development and adherence of securities market regulation. 

SEC Nigeria gained an Appendix ‘A’ Signatory to the IOSCO MMOU in 2006. Through this membership, the agency continues to measure its standards against those of the international body. It, however, does so with an understanding of the uniqueness of the local market. 

**The ISA and Even Greater Powers for the SEC**

A series of legislative decisions were executed nine years after SEC was formed. One, Decree No. 7 of 1979 was changed to Decree No. 29 of 1988. Two, a team of seven conducted an investigation of the existing capital market.   

Their goal was to understand the intricacies of this market. Once achieved, they made recommendations that spurred “The Investment and Securities Act No. 45 of 1999”. This act was published on May 26 of the same year. 

The ISA did well in expressing the SEC’s powers and potential. As a result, it was reviewed, amended, and passed into law in 2007. 

## Functions of the Securities Exchange Commission in Nigeria?

The responsibilities of the Securities and Exchange Commission are enormous. It might not look so at first sight but it always does later. This section elaborates on the broad and narrow functions of SEC Nigeria.  

#### Creating Fair Markets:

The Securities Exchange Commission in Nigeria has the responsibility of creating fair markets. One of the ways in which it ensures this is through monitoring. 

SEC monitors market participants. It checks to ensure that only suitable candidates are permitted to conduct activities. 

#### Enforcement:

SEC essentially has the power to ban a market participant. It could be a market user or a market maker - it doesn’t matter. Also, they have the power to restrict the degree of participation of one or more participants. 

The enforcement ability of SEC further goes on to cover assets, software, and other kinds of entities.   

#### Capital Formation:

Market systems basically rely on the provision and availability of capital. As such, the Securities Exchange Commission in Nigeria facilitates easy access to capital formation opportunities. The agency scrutinizes providers of stocks and bonds and equally keeps an eye out for fairness of processes. 

#### Securities Market Regulation:

From banning crypto trading to defining the powers of market actors, SEC leads market regulation. It oversees the implementation of beneficial rules. It also investigates the impact of existing regulations and may forecast likely future changes.

#### Ensuring Corporate Disclosure:

Corporate disclosure involves the release of sensitive information by a corporate body. This is often required during a court case or legal investigation. However, financial institutions sometimes refuse to give out relevant information when necessary. 

It is, therefore, the work of the Securities Exchange Commission to ensure adherence. 

This is no easy task. The SEC will first have to analyze the surrounding situation. Next, it would make a decision and have to follow up with the involved parties.  

We should mention one thing here. A company’s refusal to disclose information does not automatically imply that it is involved in a crime. Yes, information from corporate disclosures could implicate a company or its partners. Nevertheless, that is not always the case.  

Corporate disclosures may conflict with data and privacy policies, creating a challenge. 

#### Protect Investors:

SEC lives for investors. The agency generally works to assure the safety of asset buyers. How it achieves this is by banning fraudulent actors and suspicious activities. As discussed above, it also comes up with favorable and protective policies.
