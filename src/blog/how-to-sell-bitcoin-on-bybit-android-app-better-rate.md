Bybit then automatically filters out merchants that want to buy with a trading limit option for the amount range you have selected. You can further refine your options by selecting your preferred payment method (e.g., bank transfer). If you choose the bank transfer method, you will get a list of merchants that accept only Bank transfers, so select one based on what you need.

**N.B.:** A merchant with an “ineligible” tag indicates they’re either out of BTC or offline.

**Step 3:** Next, pick a merchant you’d like to trade with based on:



-   Number of completed orders

-   Percentage accuracy
