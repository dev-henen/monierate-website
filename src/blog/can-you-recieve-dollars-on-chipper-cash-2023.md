A virtual dollar account is like a regular bank account, but it's denominated in US dollars. You can use it to send and receive dollars, and you can also use it to make purchases online.

Digital dollars are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the US dollar. This means that their value is always stable, unlike other cryptocurrencies which can fluctuate wildly.

**Right now, you can only receive dollars on Chipper Cash as digital dollars. The virtual dollar account option is currently not available.**

## How to recieve Digital Dollars (USDT & USDC) on Chipper Cash

Stablecoins are like digital dollars that are pegged to the US dollar. This means that their value is always the same as the US dollar, unlike other cryptocurrencies which can fluctuate wildly. This makes them a good choice for sending and receiving money online, as you don't have to worry about your money losing value.

USDT and USDC are two of the most popular stablecoins. They are both issued by companies that are backed by real-world assets, so they are considered to be very safe.

**Chipper Cash currently allows you to receive both USDT and USDC to your dollar wallet. To do this, you need to open your Chipper Cash app, tap on "Add Cash," select "Digital Dollars," and then select the network that you want to receive the money on. An address will be generated for you, and you can then send this address to the person who is sending you money.**

Once the money has been sent, it will be credited to your Chipper Cash account in a few minutes.

**Here are some additional things to keep in mind:**

* The network that you choose will affect the transaction fees. Ethereum is the most popular network, but it also has the highest fees. Tron, Solana, and Polygon are all good options for lower fees.
* It is important to make sure that the sender and receiver agree on the network before sending the money. If the money is sent to the wrong network, it can be lost.

I hope this helps!
