### FAQs on buying USDT

**Q: What exactly is a stablecoin?**
**A:** A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a consistent value. To achieve this, it's usually backed by a reserve asset like the US dollar, gold, or even other cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins offer a way to engage with digital assets while reducing the price swings common in the crypto market.

**Q: Is Tether always $1?**
**A:** In theory, one Tether (USDT) should always equal $1 since it's designed to be pegged to the US dollar. However, real-world market dynamics might cause slight, temporary price variations across different exchanges. For example, if one exchange is offering more favourable rates than another, the price of Tether could temporarily rise or fall below its $1 peg until it resolves into equilibrium.

**Q: Can I use my Nigerian ATM card to buy USDT in Binance?**
**A:** You can typically use a Nigerian ATM card to buy USDT on Binance by selecting USDT and USD, choosing ‘Card’ as your payment method, and confirming the transaction. If it’s your first time, you’ll be prompted to add a new card. However, please note that Binance has currently suspended this service for Nigeria.

**Q: Can I transfer USDT to my bank account in Nigeria?**

**A:** To transfer USDT to your Nigerian bank account, you’ll need to sell the USDT on a cryptocurrency exchange platform that operates in Nigeria. Once sold, you can withdraw the equivalent value in Naira or USD to your bank account. Platforms like Dart Africa offer P2P services that facilitate this process.

**Q: What is the cheapest way to buy USDT?**
**A:** The most economical way to buy USDT in Nigeria would be through a platform that offers low transaction fees and competitive exchange rates. P2P exchanges like Bybit and Remitano can be a good option, as they allow you to buy USDT directly from other Nigerians, often at better rates than traditional exchanges.

**Q: How much does a USDT token cost?**
**A:** Unlike most cryptocurrencies with fluctuating prices, USDT (Tether) is designed to maintain a stable value of $1.
