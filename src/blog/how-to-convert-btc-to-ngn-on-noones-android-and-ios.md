Converting your Bitcoin (BTC) to Naira just got easier for Nigerian users on NoOnes. Now, you can conveniently complete your KYC (Know Your Customer) verification simply by entering your NIN (National Identification Number). This streamlines the process and gets you started on your P2P journey faster.



Before we get into this tutorial on how you can convert your BTC to NGN on NoOnes, there's an important factor to consider regarding the NoOnes app functionality on mobile devices (Android and iOS) in Nigeria. 



As of this writing, using the app directly might be limited. Don't worry, there's a workaround and here's what you need to know:



### Use the web version with a VPN

Here's a breakdown of the situation and some key considerations before diving in:



**Before You Begin:**

-   Ensure you have a verified NoOnes account with KYC completed.

-   Your NoOnes wallet must already hold the Bitcoin you want to convert.

-   Download a reputable VPN app compatible with your Android or iOS device such as TunnelBear Vision, VPN Satoshi and Proton VPN.



**Note that:** Using a VPN to access the NoOnes P2P marketplace on mobile might be a temporary workaround. There's a chance a future update could remove the VPN requirement.



## Convert your BTC to NGN on Noones Web in Nigeria

To convert BTC to NGN on NoOnes P2P marketplace, follow the steps below:



**Step 1:** Turn on your VPN and access NoOnes using your default browser: [](https://noones.com/buy-bitcoin) [https://noones.com/buy-crypto](https://noones.com/buy-crypto).
