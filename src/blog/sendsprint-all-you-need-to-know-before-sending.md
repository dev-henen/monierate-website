### What is SendSprint?

Launched in 2021 by Damisi Busari (formerly with Flutterwave), SendSprint was designed for Africans in the diaspora who need a fast-processing option to send money and gifts home.

Users in the US, UK, and Canada can send funds at an affordable fee directly to Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, or South Africa—whether to mobile wallets, bank accounts, or, interestingly, cash pickups.

Initially focused on the UK, SendSprint has since expanded to serve African countries and, through its [acquisition of Nobel Financial,](https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2024/08/228709-sendsprint-acquires-nobel-financial-to-expand-us-to-africa-remittance-services/) now operates in the United States. This acquisition gives SendSprint access to Nobel’s established infrastructure and customer base, boosting its growth in the American market. Strong responses from users in the US and UK have helped SendSprint gain traction, bringing it closer to its 2022 goal of reaching 300,000 customers within the first 18 months.

#### With features like:

-   Diverse currency support
-   Recurring payments
-   Business payment links
-   Gift card solutions
-   Built-in regulatory infrastructure for remittance businesses

We can say the remittance platform is almost without flaw.

|**Pros** | **Cons** |
|--|--|
| Flat fees  | The app's exclusivity to Africans abroad creates an accessibility gap, as users within Africa cannot download or use it. |
| Cash pickup option | The absence of a wallet limits flexibility, focusing solely on direct transactions.
| Payment Scheduling | Limited native app experience

## What is SendSprint’s exchange rate today?

At the time of this publication, below is the current SendSprint exchange  rate for sending money to Nigeria to Ghana:

**Nigeria**: 
- USD - 1703 NGN
- GBP - 2176 NGN

**Ghana**:
- USD - 16.30 GHS
- GBP - 20.65 GHS

One of SendSprint’s core promises is to offer fairer, more affordable exchange rates than most cross-border payment services. Given the high costs of sending money internationally, which can reach up to 8.5% in fees, this is a significant benefit.

### How much does SendSprint charge?

SendSprint adopts a transparent flat-fee model, typically charging $5 per transfer. The fee is adjusted based on the sender's currency, such as the equivalent in GBP for users in the UK.

This straightforward approach eliminates the hidden costs often associated with traditional remittance providers, ensuring users can send funds without worrying about additional deductions.

However, users must send a minimum of $10, £10, or CAD 10 per transaction. Notably, SendSprint doesn’t require deposits into a wallet. Instead, users can send money directly using payment options like MasterCard, Visa, ACH, AmEx, or their bank accounts.

### Is SendScript available on Android and iOS?

Yes, but only for international markets focused on sending money home to Africa. SendSprint primarily targets users abroad, and as of this writing, users based in Africa have reported difficulties finding or downloading the app on mobile stores. To access it on Google Play Store or App Store, search for "Sprint Technology."

SendSprint serves key markets in the UK and the U.S., offering access through both a mobile app and a website, providing users with flexibility for their transactions.

### Is SendSprint secure-proof?

SendSprint is PCI DSS Level 1 certified, ensuring compliance and security across all supported regions. During signup, passwords are end-to-end encrypted, safeguarding user data.

The platform also uses advanced protocols to protect funds and offers two-factor authentication (2FA) for additional security. Real-time transaction monitoring helps detect and address unusual activity promptly.

### How can i contact SendSprint?

### What alternatives are worth considering?

By now, you're familiar with the trade-offs of the SendSprint platform. While it provides an impressive range of features, it may lack options like wallet functionality, virtual cards, or unrestricted regional access.

Depending on your specific needs, it might be worth exploring other diaspora-focused money transfer services to find the one that suits you best. Consider alternatives such as:

-   [Nala](https://monierate.com/converter/nala?Amount=1&From=EUR&To=NGN)
-   WorldRemit
-   [Sendwave](https://monierate.com/converter/sendwave?Amount=1&From=USD&To=NGN)
-   Remitly

They are also popular among the African diaspora for their competitive rates and extensive service areas.

### Our Verdict

To be fair, SendSprint does a great job standing out with its unique value. It's built to put your needs first, connecting African payments seamlessly and efficiently.

The fee structure is refreshing, the gifting feature is thoughtful, and recurring quick payments, plus business perks, make it a solid option. It's secure too, which adds to its appeal.

If you can overlook some of the limitations we pointed out earlier—like with any payment platform—you’ll likely enjoy using SendSprint. It feels like there’s still plenty of room for growth, and we’re excited to see what they improve next.
