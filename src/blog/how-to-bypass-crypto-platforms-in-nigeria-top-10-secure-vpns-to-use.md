Hide.Me VPN is an ideal service offering a 10 GB monthly allowance. It provides a secure way to bypass blocked crypto platforms in Nigeria with features like military-grade encryption, supporting almost every platform. 

Additional benefits include a no-log policy, no ads, and no speed throttling. Plus, you do not need to sign up or log in to use Hide.Me VPN.

Hide.Me is one of the few free VPNs that support P2P torrenting. The simple sign-up process ensures you can get a free VPN without revealing your identity.

However, its speed results are underwhelming compared to competitors. 


### 2. Touch VPN

![Top 10 Secure VPNs for Crypto Trading in Nigeria](https://ik.imagekit.io/monierate/Blog/Listicles/touch-vpn.jpg)

**Available on:** Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Firefox, Edge and Chrome | **Data limit:** Unlimited | **Connections:** 5 | **Server locations:** 5900 | **Countries:** 90 | **Support:** Email | **Free Plan:** $0, **Annual Plan:** $6.67/month

With over 5,900 servers across more than 80 countries, Touch VPN enables users to unblock sites globally.

Touch VPN offers fast speeds and unlimited bandwidth with no buffering or proxy errors.

This VPN can be used for free without registration. The mobile versions have ads, but upgrading removes them and offers a faster connection, high-quality support, and coverage for up to five devices.

However, the premium plan is priced at $12.99 a month or $6.67 per month for a year, which is relatively expensive compared to other services like Private Internet Access and Surfshark.


### 3. Surfshark

![Top 10 Secure VPNs for Crypto Trading in Nigeria](https://ik.imagekit.io/monierate/Blog/Listicles/surfshark-vpn.jpeg)

**Available on:** Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, web browsers, and more | **Server locations:** 143 | **Countries:** 100 | **Customer support:** 24/7 email support, live chat, and knowledge hub | **Connections:** Unlimited | **Data limit:** Unlimited | **Annual Plan:** $4.98/month (billed $59.76 annually)

Surfshark isn't just our pick as one of the best cheap VPNs; it's also a comprehensive security suite. It includes built-in ad-blocking, antivirus, tracker-free web browsing, and a data breach notifier.

Additionally, Surfshark offers a tool called Alternative ID, which generates a new identity and email address to protect you from spam and data harvesting. It's premium protection without the high price.

Unlike many free VPNs that limit bandwidth and simultaneous connections, Surfshark provides full features without compromise.

Surfshark also supports unlimited simultaneous connections, a valuable feature for crypto enthusiasts who need to secure multiple devices at once.

### 4. CyberGhost VPN

![Top 10 Secure VPNs for Crypto Trading in Nigeria](https://ik.imagekit.io/monierate/Blog/Listicles/cyberghost-vpn.png)

**Available on:** Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS | **Data limit:** Unlimited | **Connections:** 7 | **Server locations:** 9200 | **Countries:** 100 | **Support:** Website, Live chat, Email | **Free Plan:** $0, Monthly Plan: $2.19/month (billed $39.99 annually)

CyberGhost, based in Romania and Germany, offers VPN services to 38 million users. It boasts 9,200 servers in 100 countries and has recently upgraded to faster 10 Gbps servers in over 30 countries.

You can connect up to seven devices simultaneously, though each device takes a slot, which might be inconvenient if you have many devices.

Optional dedicated IPs are available for an extra fee; however, using a dedicated IP can make you more recognizable online, but CyberGhost allows switching between dedicated and dynamic IPs.

The monthly subscription costs $12.99, but long-term plans offer significant discounts. A two-year plan costs $2.19 per month for the first term, renewing at $4.75 per month, making it one of the best introductory deals.

### 5. PrivadoVPN

![Top 10 Secure VPNs for Crypto Trading in Nigeria](https://ik.imagekit.io/monierate/Blog/Listicles/privado-vpn.png)

**Available on:** Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Smart TVs | **Data limit:** 10 GB at full speed, then unlimited via a single 1 Mbps location | **Connections:** 1 | **Server locations:** 66 | **Countries:** 13 free | **Support:** 24/7 live chat, Email | **Free Plan:** $0 (10GB/month), **Monthly Plan:** $7.99/month

If you can't afford Surfshark's subscription, consider PrivadoVPN's free plan. While not ideal for heavy streaming or torrenting, it offers a generous bandwidth limit and essential security features, making it suitable for occasional crypto trading.

PrivadoVPN excels in customization with a kill switch, always-on VPN, and split-tunneling, allowing you to access local services while streaming abroad. Its servers deliver 900 Mbps speeds, outperforming Proton VPN.

Even if you exceed the data limit, the "over-quota" mode provides unlimited data at 1 Mbps, enough for basic internet use. If you need more data, the paid plan is affordable.

### 6. Proton VPN

![Top 10 Secure VPNs for Crypto Trading in Nigeria](https://ik.imagekit.io/monierate/Blog/Listicles/proton-vpn-for-ios.png)

**Available on:** Windows, Mac, Android, iOS and Linux | **Data limit:** Unlimited | **Connections:** 10 | **Server locations:** 100 | **Countries:** 3 (Free) | **Support:** Email, live chat | **Free Plan:** $0, **Monthly Plan:** $9.99/month, Annual Plan: $4.99/month

ProtonVPN offers a robust free plan with unlimited bandwidth, access to 100 servers across three countries, and strong security features. 

Its Secure Core technology routes traffic through multiple servers for enhanced protection. Proton VPN is open-source, allowing users to verify the code for vulnerabilities.

The service also includes Quick Connect, a kill switch, MultiHop VPN, Netshield (an ad-blocker), and split tunneling. 

With its Swiss headquarters, ProtonVPN benefits from strict Swiss privacy laws and provides DNS and IPv6 leak protection, along with AES-256-GCM encryption and HMAC-384 authentication.

### 7. PureVPN

![Top 10 Secure VPNs for Crypto Trading in Nigeria](https://ik.imagekit.io/monierate/Blog/Listicles/purevpn.png)

**Available on:** Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, Linux | **Data limit:** Unlimited | **Connections:** 10 | **Server locations:** over 6,500 | **Countries:** 70 | **Support:** Website, email, live chat | **Free Plan:** $0, $2.22/monthly

There are several benefits worth mentioning of PureVPN besides its price. It has over 6,500 servers globally and allows up to 10 simultaneous device connections. It also reliably unblocks popular media services.

However, PureVPN falls short in terms of speed, mainly because it lacks WireGuard support. This makes it slower compared to competitors, so you might prefer not to keep it connected all the time to avoid potential impacts on your trading experience. 

With a 31-day money-back guarantee and essential features like strong encryption, DNS and IPv6 leak protection, torrent support, split tunneling, and a smart kill switch, this VPN is worth trying out.

### 8. Private Internet Access (PIA)

![Top 10 Secure VPNs for Crypto Trading in Nigeria](https://ik.imagekit.io/monierate/Blog/Listicles/pia-vpn.png)

**Available on:** Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, web browsers, and more | **Data limit:** Unlimited| **Connections:** Unlimited | **Server locations:** 150 | **Countries:** 91 | **Support:** 24/7 email support, live chat, and knowledge hub | **Monthly Plan:** $11.95/month, Annual Plan: $3.33/month (billed $39.95 annually)

PIAâ€™s full-featured GUI app make it ideal for power users needing extensive flexibility in installation and configuration. While its numerous features may be overwhelming for beginners, there's a simple connect button on mobile for those who prefer a straightforward setup.

PIA supports an unlimited number of devices and offers features like split-tunneling, ad/tracker/malware blocking (PIA Mace), multi-hop connections, obfuscated servers, and port-forwarding.

With a loyal customer base, PIA demonstrates reliability. The monthly plan is priced at $11.95.

The service now also offers a six-month subscription at $7.50 per month and a two-year plan at $2.19 per month with an additional two months free. Payment options include Bitcoin for extra privacy, card, or regional methods such as bank transfer in Nigeria.

### 9. SuperVPN (Androidâ€™s Best)

![Top 10 Secure VPNs for Crypto Trading in Nigeria](https://ik.imagekit.io/monierate/Blog/Listicles/supervpn-play-store.jpg)

**Available on:** Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS | **Data limit:** 500 MB | **Connections:** 1 | **Server locations:** 2 | **Countries:** 8 + 1(Paid) | **Support:** Website, email, live chat | **Monthly Plan:** $5/month, Annual Plan: $2.86/month, $1.9917 biannually

SuperVPNâ€™s menu includes a Smart Proxy feature, a basic form of split tunneling that allows you to choose which apps use the VPN and which use your regular connection.

It focuses on simplicity rather than features, and a free way to encrypt your crypto trading activities in Nigeria.

Pricing starts at $5 for a single month and drops to $2.86 per month on the annual plan, which actually costs $60 for 21 months (you get nine months free).

While this is relatively affordable, it only covers a single Android device. In comparison, Surfshark's two-year plan is $1.99 per month for up to five devices, including non-mobile devices.

However, its weak privacy policy suggest that it may not be trustworthy. Despite other concerns, reviewers report that SuperVPN passed several leak tests.

### 10. Windscribe

![Top 10 Secure VPNs for Crypto Trading in Nigeria](https://ik.imagekit.io/monierate/Blog/Listicles/windscribe-app.png)

**Available on:** Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS | **Data limit:** 10 GB | **Connections:** Unlimited | **Server locations:** 14 | **Countries:** 11 | **Support:** Website, email | **Free Plan:** $0 (10GB/month), Monthly Plan: $9/month | Annual Plan: $4.08/month (billed $49 annually)

Windscribe offers a free plan with 10 GB of data per month, featuring strong encryption, ad blocking, and a user-friendly interface. 

While not entirely free, it provides a month of 10 GB bandwidth for light users, along with protection and access to restricted content.

This VPN is also available as a browser add-on for Chrome, Opera, and Firefox. Notable features include split tunneling, a strict no-logging policy, network whitelisting, and ease of use.

Consider Windscribe if you want unlimited simultaneous connections, however, if you need more than 10 GB of data or require a truly unlimited service, you might want to explore alternatives like Proton VPN.
