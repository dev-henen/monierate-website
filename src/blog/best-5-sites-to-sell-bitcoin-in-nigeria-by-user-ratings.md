Remitano has been around for a while and is one of the more popular P2P platforms in Nigeria. It connects you directly with buyers, so you can sell your Bitcoin at rates you agree on. The platform acts as a middleman, holding the crypto in escrow until both sides are satisfied, which helps reduce scams.

That said, because it’s P2P, you’ll need a bit more patience. Transactions aren’t always instant, and you might have to wait for the right buyer to come along.

**Pros:**

- Let you choose your selling price
- Built-in escrow system adds a layer of safety

**Con:**

- Slower and more manual compared to automated over-the-counter platforms

Rating: 4.5

**Bybit** is mostly known as a global crypto exchange, but it also has a solid P2P platform where Nigerians can sell Bitcoin directly to verified buyers. The interface is clean, the trades are quick (depending on the buyer), and it supports local bank payments, which makes cashing out smooth.

It’s a good option if you’re already familiar with crypto exchanges, but first-time users might find the setup a little technical at first.

**Pros:**

- Safe, verified buyers with good trading volume
- Local payment methods like bank transfer are supported

**Con:**

- Can feel a bit complex for beginners unfamiliar with crypto exchanges

Rating: 4.0

Yellow Card is another well-known name in Nigeria’s crypto space. It lets you sell Bitcoin straight from your wallet and withdraw the Naira to your bank account.

No P2P, no waiting for a buyer, just a simple sell-and-withdraw process that works well for most users.

The app is beginner-friendly, and their customer support is pretty responsive if you ever run into issues. However, their exchange rate isn’t always the most competitive, so it’s worth checking before you sell.

**Pros:**

- Beginner-friendly interface
- Instant Naira withdrawal to Nigerian banks

**Con:**

- Exchange rates may be slightly lower than other platforms

### 5. Paxful: Popular P2P Marketplace with Lots of Flexibility

Paxful is one of the biggest P2P platforms globally, and it's widely used in Nigeria. You can sell Bitcoin to thousands of buyers using different payment methods, from bank transfers to gift cards and mobile money. It’s flexible and gives you full control over how you sell.

That said, because it’s fully P2P, you’ll need to be extra careful. Scams can still happen if you’re not paying attention, so it’s best to stick with verified buyers and always use the platform’s escrow service.

**Pros:**

- Tons of buyers and payment options
- Full control over your selling price

**Con:**

- Higher risk of scams if you're not careful
