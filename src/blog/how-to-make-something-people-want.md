How do you make something that people want? I've found that there are basically four methods:

-   Make something you want
-   Make something people are already paying for
-   Make something people are searching for
-   Make something people are spending time with

These are self-explanatory. I consider them as frameworks for making things people want. If you make anything using one of these methods, you'll end up making something people want. You can make something great by combining multiple of these methods.

There are other methods, such as making something people are already sharing, but they are complicated. And I don't recommend you try such methods.

Think of a great product like Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg **wanted the product himself**; people were already **spending money** to communicate with friends and family, and people love to **spend time** with their friends and know what their colleagues are up to.

For a financial product like Binance, I don't know if CZ created Binance to satisfy his own desires, but it's clear that people were already **investing heavily** in crypto assets; millions were already **searching for** how to buy and sell Bitcoin, and traders **spend a lot of time** on existing trading platforms.

How about a religious product like YouVersion, a Bible app with over 100 million downloads? I believe the founders wanted to make a great Bible app because most Bible apps are simple. People were already looking up Bible verses online, and Christians spend their time and money on Bible-based products.  

For a data-based product like monierate.com, we made something we wanted. Many people like to check currency exchange rates, both on the internet and in person. And as long as the world exists, people will always need to exchange currencies.

If you study any great product, you'll see it has some or all of these qualities.

Making something people want alone won't guarantee financial success, as there are other things such as marketing, management, and raising money you may need to execute. But it is the first thing you must get right, or you will fail.

I wish you great success.

## Afterthoughts

Some builders don't want to build things that already exist, but something that already exists is a good sign that you are making something people want. Facebook wasn't the fifth social media platform, Binance wasn't the tenth cryptocurrency exchange, and Stripe wasn't the third internet payment processor. You want to build something that already exists in some form but with room for improvement. Avoid working on something that doesn't exist in any form.

If you make things people are already paying for, you know people will pay for it as long as it's better.

You can make things better by making them faster, cheaper, stronger, more secure, portable, or any other way that people value what you're making.

You can think of these four tips as a framework for getting great product ideas. You may not need a framework to build anything, but using a framework can save you time, provide assurance, and reduce your chances of making common mistakes.
