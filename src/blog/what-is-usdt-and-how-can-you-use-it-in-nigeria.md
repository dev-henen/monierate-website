USDT, or Tether, is one of the most popular and widely used cryptocurrencies in the world. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, which have volatile and unpredictable prices, USDT is designed to maintain a stable value that is equal to the US dollar.

This makes [USDT](https://monierate.com/blog/how-to-convert-usdt-to-ngn-on-binance-android-app-step-by-step-guide) a convenient and reliable way of exchanging value on the blockchain, especially for traders and investors who want to hedge against market fluctuations and lock in their profits. 

In this article, we will explain what USDT is, how it works, and how you can use it in Nigeria to trade, invest, and transact with cryptocurrencies.


## What is USDT

USDT is a type of cryptocurrency that is also known as a stablecoin. A stablecoin is a crypto that is pegged to another asset, such as a fiat currency, a commodity, or another crypto and tries to maintain a stable and consistent value in relation to that asset. 

USDT is pegged to the US dollar, meaning that one USDT token is always supposed to be worth one US dollar. USDT is issued and managed by a Hong Kong-based company called Tether, which claims to back every USDT token with an equivalent amount of US dollars or other assets in its reserves. Tether publishes its reserve holdings daily on its website and also undergoes periodic audits by independent firms to verify its claims.


##  Founders of USDT

USDT is a controversial stablecoin that was created in 2014 by Brock Pierce, Reeve Collins, and Craig Sellars as Realcoin, and later renamed to Tether. It runs on the Bitcoin blockchain using the Omni Protocol and claims to be backed by US dollar reserves. 

However, its issuer, Tether, has faced many issues, such as banking problems, lack of transparency, legal disputes, and market manipulation allegations. In 2019, Tether and its partner exchange, Bitfinex, settled a lawsuit with the New York Attorney General for $18.5 million.

## What makes Tether stand out from other stablecoins

Tether is still the center of speculation in cryptocurrency markets and blockchain networks, with many users not trusting their liquidity and stability. However, it has some unique features that set it apart from other stablecoins. Some of them include:


#### Stability

The main feature of USDT is its stable value. Each USDT token is meant to be equal to 1 USD, which makes it a dependable way of storing and exchanging value in the crypto space.


#### Reserve Backing 

To keep this value stable, Tether says that it has the same amount of US Dollars in reserve as the number of USDT tokens that are out there. This reserve backing is checked regularly by audits to make sure that it is true and follows the rules.


#### Liquidity 

USDT is accepted by many cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms, making it a popular option for traders and investors who want to move money in and out of the crypto market quickly and avoid the price changes of other cryptocurrencies. 


#### Transparency 

Tether has tried to be more transparent by giving regular updates on the reserve holdings and letting third-party auditors check them. This transparency aims to create trust among users and regulators.


## How USDT works

USDT works by issuing tokens based on demand and backed by a reserve of US dollars. It is traded on cryptocurrency exchanges and adjusted to keep its value at 1 US dollar. 

Tether Ltd., the company behind USDT, creates and sends tokens to users who pay with US Dollars and claims to hold enough US dollars in a bank account to redeem the tokens when needed. 

Tether may also create or redeem tokens to keep its supply and demand in balance.


## How to use USDT in Nigeria

Tether (USDT) is very useful for different things in the crypto world, such as:

- **Trading:** Nigerian Traders like to use USDT as a main currency to trade other cryptos. When they think the market will go down, they can change their assets to USDT to keep their value and avoid losing money because of price changes.

- **Hedging:** USDT can help you to hedge against market changes. Investors can move their assets to USDT to keep their money safe during times of trouble in the market.

- **Transferring Funds:** USDT allows you to send and receive money fast and safely across crypto exchanges or wallets without worrying about the price changes of other tokens.

- **Holding Stable Value:** USDT gives you a way to store your assets stably without the need to change them back to naira or other currencies.

- **Arbitrage:** Some traders use USDT to make money from crypto arbitrage, which is when you use the price differences between exchanges to buy and sell cryptos quickly and make a profit.

## What are USDT transaction fees

To make the most of the use cases above, it's important to be aware of the fees typically involved in processing and verifying transactions on the blockchain and how they can influence your USDT/NGN trading experiences and otherwise:

- **The Blockchain Network:** The fees depend on the blockchain network that you use for the USDT transaction. For example: On the Ethereum network (ERC-20 USDT), fees are measured in Ether (ETH) and can change based on network traffic. Ethereumâ€™s fees can go from a few cents to several dollars, depending on network demand. On the [Tron network](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/tron-trc-20-token-standards) (TRC-20 USDT), transactions usually have lower fees than Ethereum.

- **The Network Congestion:** When the blockchain network has [many transactions,](https://www.howtogeek.com/732892/what-is-network-congestion-and-how-can-you-work-around-it/) fees go up as users try to have their transactions processed fast. During times of high demand, you may have to pay more fees to make sure your USDT transaction is processed quickly.

- **The Wallet or Exchange Fees:** Some wallets or cryptocurrency exchanges may add more fees for processing USDT transactions. These fees can be different between service providers.

- **Transaction Type:** The fee can also change depending on the type of USDT transaction. For example, sending USDT from one wallet to another may have a different fee than changing USDT for another cryptocurrency. 

To know the exact transaction fees for your USDT transaction, you should check with the [wallet or exchange](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/best-crypto-wallets/) that you use. They often give fee estimates or let you choose the transaction fee that you want, which can affect how fast your transaction is confirmed on the blockchain. 

Also, [blockchain explorers](https://blockchair.com/tron) for specific networks can give real-time information on current transaction fees.


## Where to buy USDT in Nigeria

Some of these exchanges are user-friendly while others are not. For example, Binance offers a gift card option to buy crypto on its platform, and that might be easier for you.

Compare the fees, rates, and security of each platform before making a transaction.
