## What has changed since 2005?

Payoneer’s story is one of continuous innovation and growth in the international financial services industry. Founded in 2005 by Yuval Tal and Ben Green with the goal of making international payments easier, the company initially gained traction as a solution for freelancers and online marketplaces needing a reliable way to handle cross-border transactions.

By 2010, Payoneer had expanded its services to include businesses of all sizes, marking the beginning of its global presence. Significant growth followed in 2013 with an increase in the number of supported currencies and countries, and by 2015, the company secured substantial investments that fueled further development, including the introduction of new products like lending services for small and medium-sized businesses.

In 2018, Payoneer integrated advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence, to enhance user experience and transaction security. However, the company faced challenges in 2020 when it struggled to convert its mobile web traffic into mobile app users. Despite the substantial influx of traffic to its mobile web platform, Payoneer lacked an effective means of bridging the gap between its website and app.

In 2020, Payoneer ran into some trouble getting people to move from their mobile website to their mobile app. Even though a lot of people were visiting their mobile site, not many were making the jump to download the app. To fix this, in 2021, they started using smart banners and deep links that encouraged users to download the app directly from the website. They teamed up with Branch, a company that specializes in making this transition smoother. This change really helped Payoneer get more people using their app and made the whole process a lot easier for users.

## What is Payoneer’s business model?

One thing to keep in mind is that Payoneer, like any other payment platform, charges a fee for each transaction. It’s not a free service, but it does offer a low-cost solution for international banking.

So, how does Payoneer make money? The answer is pretty straightforward—it's all about commissions. Every time you use Payoneer to send or receive money, they take a small cut. That’s why they need as many people as possible to use the platform and all its features. The more users interact with Payoneer, the more revenue they generate. It’s a simple business model, really—get more people on board, and the profits follow.

Payoneer has also partnered up with MasterCard, which means they’ve got some serious backing. They work with all kinds of partners, from global platforms to business consultants. This helps them offer even more ways to connect with clients and get paid, no matter where you are in the world.

### So how much does Payoneer make per transaction?

#### 1. Currency Exchange Rate

When you exchange currencies through Payoneer, they add up to a 2% fee on top of the mid-market rate. Typically, the person receiving the payment covers this cost. But if the recipient isn’t a Payoneer user, the sender picks up the tab. And if you’re just moving money between different currencies within your Payoneer wallet, there’s a 0.5% fee.

**Total Value Generated:** For every $1,000 exchanged, Payoneer earns $20 (2%) or $5 (0.5%) for internal transfers.

#### 2. Transfer Fees

The fees here can vary:

-  If you’re transferring money from one Payoneer account to another and it’s in USD or EUR, it’s free. But for other currencies, you might get hit with a 1% fee.
    
-   Need to request a payment from a client? Payoneer has a handy billing feature for that. If your client pays via Mastercard, there’s a 3% fee; for eCheck, it’s just 1%. Plus, if you’re withdrawing money from certain online marketplaces into Payoneer, there might be a small fee, though this often depends more on the marketplace than Payoneer.
 
**Total Value Generated:** For a $1,000 transfer, Payoneer earns $10 (1%) or $30 (3%) for Mastercard payments, and $10 (1%) for eCheck payments.

#### 3. Withdrawal of Funds

Payoneer is linked up with a bunch of banks worldwide. For most of these, withdrawing your money is free, especially when you’re transferring to local banks. But if your account is in USD or EUR, there’s a $1.50 fee for each withdrawal.

**Total Value Generated:** For each withdrawal in USD or EUR, Payoneer earns $1.50.

#### 4. Debit Card Charges

Payoneer gives you a debit card to make things easier. The card itself is free, but using it comes with some costs. For every transaction, there’s a $3 fee. Cancel a transaction? That’ll be $1. ATM inquiry? Another $1.
    
**Total Value Generated:** For each transaction, Payoneer earns $3, and for each cancellation or ATM inquiry, they earn $1.

By being aware of the various fees, such as currency exchange rates, transfer fees, and withdrawal charges, users can strategically plan their transactions to avoid unnecessary expenses.

This knowledge helps in choosing the most cost-effective methods for transferring and withdrawing funds, ultimately enhancing the efficiency of your financial operations and maximizing your earnings.

### How to optimize your Payoneer usage and minimize unexpected costs

To get the most out of Payoneer, follow these tips:

-   **Choose the right currency**: Whenever possible, transfer funds in the same currency to avoid currency exchange fees.
    
-   **Take advantage of free transfers**: Use free transfers between Payoneer accounts in USD or EUR to save on transaction costs.
    
-   **Plan and monitor withdrawals**: Withdraw larger amounts less frequently to minimize fees. Also, keep an eye on exchange rates to transfer funds when rates are favorable.
    
-   **Stay Informed**: Regularly check Payoneer’s fee schedule and updates to stay aware of any changes.
    
-   **Understand marketplace fees**: Be mindful of extra fees from online marketplaces when withdrawing funds.
    
-   **Secure your account**: Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication to protect your account from unauthorized access.
  

### Tips on how to use Payoneer effectively for International Payments

There are sweet conveniences for international transactions, like using the Payoneer MasterCard Debit card to access ATMs worldwide and make purchases online or in stores that accept MasterCard.

To make the most of these perks though, remember to:

1.  Use Payoneer’s Global Payment Service to receive payments in multiple currencies from international clients.
    
2.  Utilize Payoneer’s billing feature to request payments from clients, ensuring you choose the most cost-effective payment method.
    
3.  Convert currencies within your Payoneer wallet when rates are favourable to save on conversion fees.
    
4.  Make purchases directly with the Payoneer card to avoid withdrawal fees.
