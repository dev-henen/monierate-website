![21 Ways To Get Rich In Bitcoin by Michael Saylor](https://ik.imagekit.io/monierate/Blog/Listicles/21-ways-to-get-rich-in-Bitcoin.webp?updatedAt=1749508600120)

In a keynote speech in the [Bitcoin Conference 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=YF6U8gaAW4gUkuz5&v=reVebuAf_Cs&feature=youtu.be), Michael Saylor shared 21 ways to wealth in Bitcoin. It's more like a blueprint, but we'll help you with it so you don't have to.

So let's get into it. While he called it **'21 Ways to Wealth, '** I will call it **'21 Leverage Points to Live By.'**


### 1. Clarity

**‚ÄúBitcoin is capital, perfected, programmable, and incorruptible.‚Äù**

Most people chase money. Saylor figured out the source.

Bitcoin is one of the closest things to divine math. If you don‚Äôt understand it, I can tell you wealth will avoid you like it owes you money.

**I want you to ask yourself:** If you had $10 million and your only job was to not lose it, would you park it in a bank, a building, or in something that can‚Äôt be diluted, censored, or seized?


### **2. Conviction**

**"Bitcoin will appreciate faster than every other asset because it‚Äôs engineered to outperform."**

You don‚Äôt get wealthy by diversifying into mediocrity. You get wealthy by going all in on a truth before the world accepts it.

Bitcoin is not an investment, I can tell you, it‚Äôs an exit. Real estate guys hoard buildings. Oil tycoons hoard land. In 2025, I expect nothing short from you, that is, you as an individual should hoard **Sats**.


### 3. Courage

**"Some are scared of the fire. Others jump in and build inside it."**

The Bitcoin world is still noisy, messy, and full of doubters. But all wealth creation begins when most people stop paying attention.

If you want to win, you‚Äôve got to be willing to get singed while everyone else waits for the smoke to clear.

Go all in! 


### 4. Cooperation

**"When your family is plugged in, you‚Äôre more powerful."**

One person with courage is good.

A family unit with courage, capital, and competence. That‚Äôs how you build dynastic wealth.

**Teach your siblings. Nudge your partner. Share the Saylor clips. And a quick tip: On the first date, casually ask if they know what a Satoshi is. Their answer might tell you more about them üòÇ**


### 5. Capability

**"Master AI. It‚Äôs every discipline in your pocket, only if you know how to prompt it."**

Before you see a lawyer, talk to ChatGPT. Before you hire a strategist, run your plan through Claude or Perplexity. Ask your AI to simulate a board of directors. Ask it how to legally structure your next Bitcoin endeavor.

If your friends don‚Äôt use AI, reduce contact, you can call. it a new class divide. I don't care, It is just the truth. (Harsh, but fair.) 


### 6. Composition

**"Build legal entities that protect and scale your wealth."**

Wealthy people don‚Äôt ‚Äòown‚Äô assets. Their structures do; you don‚Äôt need to wait until you‚Äôre rich to think like you are.

Start an entity, Prompt AI to help you do it. And get smart because your company is the shell that will protect your treasure.


### 7. Citizenship

**"Choose the economic battlefield that respects your freedom."**

Saylor didn‚Äôt say move to El Salvador, but he might as well have. Your country of birth isn‚Äôt your economic destiny, JAPA I am not advocating for it, but if need be, do justice.

Google ‚Äútop 10 Bitcoin-friendly jurisdictions.‚Äù 

Another added tip: Ask:

- Which countries respect Bitcoin sovereignty?

- Which state taxes you less for hodling? ( And your generation will thank you for doing the needful).


### 8. Civility

**"Respect the force of nature. Don‚Äôt fight every battle."**

Just because you‚Äôre right doesn‚Äôt mean you should fight, because if you don't know, the world is run on social consensus.

You don‚Äôt need to argue with every Dogecoin fan. Or correct every Fiat apologist on Twitter.

Wealth is long-term. So choose your battles, and more importantly, choose your peace.


### 9. Corporation

**"The most powerful wealth-creation engine on Earth is: A well-structured corporation."**

If you‚Äôre moving through life as an individual, you‚Äôre in pawn mode.

A corporation can raise capital, take risks, and shield its liability. Learn how to create one, then learn how to scale one.

Ask AI questions: How do I form an LLC that can accept Bitcoin payments and raise capital legally? And lots more.


### 10. Focus

**"Just because you can do something, doesn‚Äôt mean you should."**

The #1 thing that made Saylor rich was **Ignoring** distractions.

He could‚Äôve started 10 startups, but chose to bet the house on Bitcoin. Some people are older than him in the space but not as wealthy as him because they couldn't focus on Bitcoin but want to build a new yo-yo coin üíî


### 11. Equity

**"Share opportunities with those willing to share your risk."**

You don‚Äôt need to go it alone.

If you have a powerful idea, create the strategy, structure the deal, and invite others to own a piece. Equity is the language of alignment. Embrace it! 


### 12. Credit

**"Turn risk into yield by offering certainty."**

Instead of just raising money. Offer investors clarity, give them a fixed return, Seniority, or a role in your structure.

Investors don‚Äôt want 10x returns, they want 1x returns they can count on.


### 13. Compliance

**"Build the best company within the rules of your market."**

Bitcoin might be freedom, but companies still operate in jurisdictions. And jurisdictions come with rules and loopholes. Learn to play within the rules until you can afford to write them.


### 14. Capitalisation

**"Raise and reinvest, relentlessly."**

Money sitting is money dying. Reinvest. Raise. Compound.

If you believe Bitcoin will outperform, don‚Äôt just buy it. Multiply your ability to buy it again and again.


### 15. Communication

**"Nobody will fund you if they don‚Äôt trust you."**

Communicate like your reputation is your product.

Speak with clarity. Act with transparency. And if you can‚Äôt explain your strategy on a voice note in 90 seconds, you probably don‚Äôt understand it. So build on it!


### 16. Commitment

**"Don‚Äôt get distracted."**

People found Bitcoin before Saylor. But they lost focus. Chased hype. Built coins with names that aged like expired milk.

Commitment means that **you Ignore the noise and hold the line and it can be boring**, but boring is what makes billionaires.


### 17. Competence

**"The world expects you to be excellent."**

Competence is boring until it‚Äôs bankable.

Excellence is no longer optional because when the world trusts you with capital, deliver like your name is on the line.


### 18. Adaptation

**"Everything will eventually break‚Äîincluding you."**

The goal is not to avoid change, it is for you to be so adaptive that you remain dangerous no matter the conditions.


### 19. Evolution

**"Never abandon your strengths. Amplify them."**

Build with what you have. Scale with what you know.

You don‚Äôt need to become something new, you just need to become more of who you already are- but on steroids.

Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt change your nature. It only multiplies it.


### 20. Advocacy

**"Inspire others to walk the Bitcoin path."**

Just like we are doing on this channel, If it changed your life, let it change others too.

If you believe Bitcoin is freedom, teach it, Tweet, Talk, and Tattoo it on your business. Evangelise it without being annoying.

The more you teach, the more you understand.


### 21. Generosity

**"Share joy. Deliver hope."**

Don‚Äôt hoard wealth. Circulate it.

Help a friend set up a wallet. Gift Sats to your niece. Sponsor someone‚Äôs education in Bitcoin. If your wealth doesn‚Äôt help others, it will definitely destroy you.

I guess I told you beforehand that this is a playbook, read implement and share!
