**So as a Vacation Rental Host, a Payoneer account will let you:**
- Receive payments from platforms like Airbnb, Booking.com, and Vrbo.
- Manage multiple property payments in one account.
- Withdraw your earnings to your local bank account at low rates.
- Pay property management fees and other expenses directly from your Payoneer account.

**As an Affiliate Marketer, you can also:**
- Get paid by affiliate networks like CJ Affiliate, ShareASale, and Rakuten.
- Consolidate payments from multiple networks.
- Withdraw your earnings to your local bank account at low rates.
- Use the Payoneer card to access funds globally.

## How does Payoneer work?
Payoneer works in three basic steps:

1.  Create Your Account: Sign up for free on Payoneer's website ([https://www.payoneer.com/accounts/](https://www.payoneer.com/accounts/)) as an individual or a business. You'll need basic information like your name, email, and contact details.
    
2.  Receive Funds: Once your account is approved (usually within 1-3 business days), you can start receiving payments from over 1,000 online platforms and marketplaces. Some clients might even pay you directly through Payoneer.
    
3.  Access Your Money: Withdraw your funds to your local bank account, use your Payoneer debit Mastercard at ATMs worldwide, or even shop online and in stores.
  
There are a few things to keep in mind though:
-   Payoneer may require proof of US activity for a local US account.
-   A minimum of $2,000 in transactions per year is needed to keep your account active. **You will be charged if 12 months pass and you have received less than 2,000.00 USD (or equivalent) in payments**.
-   Payoneer isn't for personal transactions—sending money to friends or family could get your account closed.

## Using Payoneer: Bank Transfers, Payoneer Transfers, MasterCard and Transfer Speed
Payoneer makes managing your money easier, especially if you deal with regular international transactions.

**Transferring money from Payoneer to your bank account** is straightforward and reliable. Payoneer supports bank transfers to accounts in Nigeria, the UK, and many other countries, providing flexibility for international transactions. Unlike PayPal, which restricts Nigerian accounts from receiving funds or transferring them to a bank, Payoneer allows both receiving and transferring money to your bank.

For **Payoneer-to-Payoneer transfers,** the process is simple. You only need the recipient's Payoneer email address to send money. There are no transaction fees for this service, making it an economical option for transferring funds between Payoneer accounts.

Using the **Payoneer MasterCard** is another gem available to all account holders. This debit card can be used for online and in-store purchases, as well as for ATM withdrawals. To get the card, you must create a Payoneer account and receive at least $200 into your Payoneer balance.

In terms of **transfer speeds,** it’s generally quick, with batch payments processed instantly. For example, sending $10,000 from USD to EUR can be completed within a few hours. However, the time it takes to receive payments from a marketplace depends on the marketplace itself, not Payoneer. If you're expecting a large payment, it's advisable to contact support in advance to prevent delays due to payment flags.

|                  | From Marketplaces                | Fees are determined by the respective marketplace (e.g., Fiverr, Upwork, Airbnb, Wish). |
| **Sending Money** | Payoneer to Payoneer Transfers   | Free                                                                |

**Card Fees**
Payoneer offers physical and virtual cards, which come with various fees:
-   **Annual Card Fee:** The first card costs $29.95 annually. Additional cards are free.
-   **Transactions in the Same Currency:** Free.
-   **Transactions with Currency Conversion:** Up to 3.5% above the mid-market rate.
-   **ATM Withdrawals:** $3.15 (USD), €2.50 (EUR), or £1.95 (GBP) per withdrawal.

Virtual cards are available at no extra cost, with the same currency conversion fees applied as with physical cards.

### Additional Considerations
-   **Minimum Transaction Requirement:** To keep your account active, you need to have at least $2,000 in transactions annually. Failing to meet this threshold could lead to account closure, especially if transactions are flagged as personal payments rather than business-related.
 
-   **Card Spending Limits:** Payoneer commercial cards have a daily spending limit that can go up to $200,000, making them suitable for high-volume business transactions.
    
These fees can vary based on location or the specific service being used, so it's always wise to check [Payoneer’s website](http://payoneer.com) for the latest information.

## Is Payoneer safe and regulated?
When it comes to safety, Payoneer takes security seriously. It's regulated under an e-money license in the European Union and holds various licenses across the United States. This means Payoneer is treated with the same level of scrutiny as any traditional bank.

Some of which include:

1.  **Transaction Verification:** Every transaction is closely monitored. For large transfers or transactions involving new contacts, Payoneer staff manually verify the details before processing.
    
2.  **Bank Account Matching:** Before you can withdraw funds to a bank account, Payoneer ensures that the name on the bank account matches exactly with the name on the Payoneer account. This helps prevent unauthorized withdrawals.
    
3.  **Transfer Reason:** Whenever you send money from your Payoneer account to another Payoneer user, you must clearly state the purpose of the transfer. This adds an extra layer of transparency and security.
    
4.  **Immediate Notifications:** As soon as you request to send funds, Payoneer sends an email notification to the account owner. This immediate alert allows you to act quickly if the transaction wasn't authorized.
    
5.  **Customer Support:** Payoneer provides round-the-clock customer support. You can reach them via phone, email, or live chat, ensuring help is available whenever you need it.
    
Outside of this, there are more security measures put in place:
-   **2-Step Verification:** This adds an extra layer of protection by requiring a verification code sent to your phone before certain actions can be completed on your account.
    
-   **CAPTCHA Requests:** To prevent automated attacks, Payoneer uses CAPTCHA tests to ensure that actions on the website are performed by real users, not bots.
    
-   **RSA Adaptive Authentication:** This system assesses the risk of a transaction based on factors like location and device. If something seems off, additional authentication steps may be required.
    
-   **Account Takeover Prevention:** Payoneer monitors for unusual activity, such as sudden changes in account settings or login attempts from unfamiliar locations, to protect against unauthorized access.

- **Risk Model and Behavior Profiling:** By analyzing user behavior, Payoneer can quickly identify and respond to potential security threats, keeping your account safe from fraud.

## Payoneer Support and Account Management
Payoneer offers various ways to get help when you need it. You can reach out through their website, app, or by phone. While they have a team available to assist you around the clock, the level of support can vary depending on your specific needs.

**For general questions or troubleshooting, the online help center is a good starting point.** It covers a wide range of topics and can often answer your questions without needing to contact support directly.

If you prefer to talk to someone, Payoneer offers **phone and live chat support in different languages.** Keep in mind that live chat might involve waiting in a queue, especially during busy times.

**For complex issues or large transactions, Payoneer offers dedicated account managers.** This service is typically reserved for businesses or high-volume users.

![Monierate Payoneer Review](https://ik.imagekit.io/monierate/Blog/Listicles/payoneer-support.png)
While Payoneer's support team is generally helpful, remember they focus on technical assistance rather than financial advice. If you need help with investment strategies or economic forecasts, you might want to consult a financial advisor.

## Payoneer vs. Paypal
Today, Payoneer and PayPal are key players in online payment services. They both allow users to send and receive money but cater to slightly different markets.

Payoneer is often favoured by businesses and professionals who need to handle international transactions, while PayPal is widely used for personal and commercial purposes.

The table below might help you decide which one best suits your needs:

| Company Size | Small to medium businesses and freelancers | Large enterprises |

| Fees | Receiving: FREE / 1% | Receiving: 0.005% + 4-5% above market rate |
| Pricing Model | Quote-based | Monthly payment |

### Bottom Line
As you can see, both Payoneer and PayPal have their strengths and can be the right choice depending on what you're looking to achieve. Payoneer shines when it comes to international transactions and often has lower fees for receiving payments. 

It's particularly advantageous for larger transactions and cross-border payments. On the other hand, PayPal offers a user-friendly experience with broad acceptance and integration options for various e-commerce platforms.

Payoneer is beneficial if you need to access funds quickly through a debit card or handle transactions in different currencies. PayPal, however, is convenient for straightforward transactions and is widely accepted across various online platforms.

If you’re deciding between the two, consider your specific needs regarding **transaction volume,** **international accessibility,** and **integration with other services.**

## Other Alternatives to Payoneer
If Payoneer does not cut it for you, you might want to consider these options:
