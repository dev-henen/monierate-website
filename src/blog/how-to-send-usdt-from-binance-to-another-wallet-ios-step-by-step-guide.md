## Transferring USDT to another wallet using the Binance iOS Lite

To transfer USDT from Binance to another wallet in the iOS Lite interface, follow the steps below:

![Binance Lite toggle](https://ik.imagekit.io/monierate/Blog/Binance%20articles/binance-lite-toggle.jpg)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Wallets

-   Open both your sending and receiving wallet apps. Ensure USDT is enabled within your receiving wallet.
-   Locate your USDT balance in the sending wallet (Binance).

### Step 2: Copy the Receiving Address

-   On your receiving wallet app, locate the USDT address and copy it entirely. This address acts like your bank account number, so ensure you copy it accurately.

### Step 3: Initiate Withdrawal on Binance

-   Open the Binance app and tap "Wallet". This will take you to your Binance wallet overview.
-   Select "Spot" and find "Tether (USDT)". Here, you'll see your USDT holdings within the Binance Spot wallet.
-   Tap "Withdraw" to initiate the USDT transfer process.

### Step 4: Complete the Withdrawal process

-   Paste the copied USDT address into "Recipient Address" field. Double-check to ensure you've copied and pasted the address correctly.
-   Next, select the appropriate network. This is an important step! Choose the same network that your receiving wallet supports for USDT. Common options include BEP20, ERC20, etc. Selecting an incompatible network can result in lost funds.

### Step 6: Confirm transaction

-   You can track the transaction progress within your Binance app. The app will usually display the status of your USDT transfer.
-   Once complete, verify the USDT balance in your receiving wallet app. It might take some time for the transfer to be reflected in your receiving wallet, depending on the chosen network.

## Transfering USDT from Binance to another wallet is a straight-forward process both on Binance Lite and Binance Pro: 

Here are 5 steps to transfer USDT from Binance to another wallet

1. Select the appropriate network on your reciepient wallet of choice.

2. Copy the wallet address from your the same wallet.

3. Select USDT and proceed to withdraw on Binance.

4. Enter the transaction details and withdraw the USDT using your preferred network.
