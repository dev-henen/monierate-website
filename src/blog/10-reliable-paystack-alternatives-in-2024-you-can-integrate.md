![Alternatives to Paystack API in 2024](https://ik.imagekit.io/monierate/Blog/Listicles/10%20Reliable%20Payment%20APIs%20Alternatives%20to%20Paystack.png)

Paystack has made its mark as a leading payment gateway in Nigeria, serving businesses that need to accept online payments smoothly.

However, its popularity brings challenges such as downtime, higher fees, and limitations like transaction splitting. This encourages businesses to explore alternative payment solutions that better fit their specific needs and save you time.

So, if you're ready to build that e-commerce project and want options beyond Paystack, you're in the right place. We've gathered insights from developers and experts on the top 10 payment API contenders in Africa. 

**Some of which include: Flutterwave, Squad, Remita, SeerBit, Interswitch, and Monnify.**

Let’s get into it.

## The Top 10 Paystack API alternatives in Nigeria

We selected these payment API providers based on their pricing transparency. Our evaluation also considered reviews, transaction speed, customer support, and customization options, particularly those that effectively manage transaction percentage splitting.

**N.B:** At the time of writing, Paystack API can handle transaction splitting. However, it requires manual setup, necessitating individual split accounts for varying percentages. This complicates payment management, as users cannot create a single account for multiple splits.

So, in no particular order:

### Korapay

![Alternatives to Paystack API in 2024](https://ik.imagekit.io/monierate/Blog/Listicles/korapay.png)

Cost: Zero set-up costs. 1.5% on local transactions, capped at ₦2,000 | Settlement time: Next day | Payment options: Cards, bank transfers, mobile money, and pay with bank | Security: PCI DSS Level 1 | Recurrent billing: Yes

First up on our list is Kora Checkout, a flexible option for handling both one-time purchases and recurring subscriptions. It covers all the major payment methods, so your customers can pay however they prefer. Their APIs securely collect payment details on both web and mobile platforms.

KoraPay is gaining traction with businesses like GIG Logistics, and operates beyond Nigeria, with a presence in Canada, the UK, and Europe. There are no setup or maintenance fees and their API allows businesses to integrate features directly into their applications, making it easy to get started with free test keys and explore how it fits into your project.

Kora offers tools like payment links for businesses without websites, and with a significant transaction success rate on bank transfers, it’s a solid alternative to Paystack.

Bloc API, launched in 2021, is another one-stop shop for payments, connecting your business to a wide range of providers. Bloc makes it easy for your customers to pay you however they prefer and protects your sensitive payment details with advanced measures. 

The Checkout API also acts as your financial control center, providing real-time reports and a centralized view of all your transactions. And if there's ever a hiccup with one of your payment providers, their clever "auto-switching" feature keeps things running without missing a beat.

And here's the cherry on top: Bloc lets you add an extra processing fee to bill payments, with 100% of that fee going straight to you. It's a smart way to boost your revenue while still earning your regular commission on each transaction.

## What to look for in a Payment API Provider

When choosing a payment API provider, there's a lot to consider. First off, you want **a well-designed API** that's easy for your developers to understand and use. **Look for clear documentation, intuitive naming conventions, and helpful error messages.** Make sure the API is reliable, handling retries gracefully without causing issues.

**Security and compliance** are crucial when dealing with financial data. Check for strong authentication measures, data encryption, and compliance with industry regulations. You also want **an API that can handle your current needs** and scale as your business grows.

**Don't forget about the practicalities.** Is the documentation clear and up-to-date? Does the provider offer responsive support? And of course, **consider the cost structure** and make sure it aligns with your budget.

Finally, think about the specific features you need. **Do you want to offer multiple payment methods?** **Is customization important to you?** Look for an API that supports your goals and gives you the flexibility to create the payment experience you want for your customers.
