Monierate is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. This data policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information.

**What information do we collect?**

We only collect user emails. We collect this information via a form on our website. We simply ask the user to subscribe to our updates or "Alerts" by entering their email address. We then send a code to their email to confirm their submission.

**How do we use your information?**

We use your email address to send you product updates and Monierate Alerts. We may also use your email address to send you marketing materials.

**How do we protect your information?**

All of our data is securely hosted in a cloud database and it is only accessible to our internal team. We currently do not collect any sensitive information such as credit cards, date of birth, bank details or any information that can lead to impersonation or harm to our users in a situation of data breach. Also we made it easy for our subscribers to easily unsubscribe from our updates or mailing list by including an unsubscribe link at the bottom of every email we sent them.

**How long do we retain your information?**

We retain your information for as long as you are subscribed to our updates or Alerts. You may unsubscribe at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email we send you.
